No ESBL enzyme production could be detected in the other 21 ceftazidime-resistant isolates. In these, we found 6 (15%) to be susceptible to carbapenems, suggesting ampC beta-lactamase production as the underlying mechanism of resistance to ceftazidime, and the remaining 15 (37.5%) isolates to be resistant to carbapenems, suggesting carbapenemase enzyme production as the underlying mechanism of resistance to ceftazidime and to the carbapenems themselves."
