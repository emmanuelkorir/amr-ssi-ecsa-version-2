Here, we report on a spectrum of bacteria associated with surgical site infections in two referral\nhospitals in Eritrea and the associated antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Methods. +is survey was conducted between February\nand May 2017. A total of 83 patients receiving treatment for various surgical conditions were included. Swabs from infected\nsurgical sites were collected using Levine technique and processed using standard microbiological procedures. In vitro anti-\nmicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on Mueller–Hinton Agar by the Kirby-Bauer disk diﬀusion method following\nClinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. +e data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Results. A total of 116\nisolates were recovered from 83 patients. In total, 67 (58%) and 49 (42%) of the isolates were Gram-positive and Gram-negative\nbacteria, respectively. +e most common isolates included Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus spp.,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Acinetobacter spp. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus, CONS,\nand Streptococcus viridians were the predominant Gram-positive isolates. All the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to\npenicillin. MRSA phenotype was observed in 70% of the isolates. Vancomycin, clindamycin, and erythromycin resistance were\nobserved in 60%, 25%, and 25% of the isolates, respectively. Furthermore, a high proportion (91%) of the Gram-negative bacteria\nwere resistant to ampicillin and 100% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to >5 of the tested\nantibiotics. +e two Acinetobacter isolates were resistant to >7 antimicrobial agents. We also noted that 4 (60%) of the Klebsiella\nisolates were resistant to >5 antimicrobial agents. Possible pan-drug-resistant (PDR) strains were also isolated. Conclusion. Due to\nthe high frequency of MDR isolates reported in this study, the development and implementation of suitable infection control\npolicies and guidelines is imperative.\n"

    "text": "causing increasing concern in diﬀerent hospital departments\n(internal medicine, intensive care units (ICUs), surgery) and\nlong-term-care settings [2, 3].\nImportantly, molecular proﬁles of isolates from appar-\nently unrelated infections have reported widespread inter-\nspecies transfer of genes encoding antibiotic resistance, adding\nanother facet to the threat posed by these organisms [1]. In\nfact, a high level of resistance to the commonly prescribed\nantibiotics like penicillin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, trimetho-\nprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), chloramphenicol, and\nthird-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and\nceftriaxone) has been described in multiple countries in sub-\nSaharan Africa (SSA) [4–7].\nIn general, multidrug resistance (MDR) (concomitant\nresistance to ≥3 diﬀerent antimicrobial classes) is a com-\nmon trait in these isolates [1, 6, 8, 9]. In particular, extended\nspectrum-β-lactamases\n(ESBLs,\nclass\nA)\nand\nAmpC\nβ-lactamases (class C)-producing Escherichia coli and\nKlebsiella species have been described [6]. Previous reports\nof isolates that are resistant to second-generation cepha-\nlosporins and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combina-\ntions in the absence of ESBL-containing plasmids exist [10].\nIn\naddition,\nhealthcare-associated\nmethicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) oxacillin/nafcillin-re-\nsistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA); penicillin-resistant\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP); vancomycin-resistant\nenterococci (VRE), and carbapenem-resistant and ﬂuo-\nroquinolone-resistant\nPseudomonas\naeruginosa\nand\nEnterobacteriaceae have also emerged as important families\nof healthcare-associated pathogens worldwide [6, 11].\nOverall, multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates complicate\ntreatment and often result in extended hospital stay and\nhigher morbidity and mortality [1].\nAt present, the emergence and rapid global spread of\nMDR threatens the gains made in the previous decades on the\ntreatment and control of multiple bacterial infections. Im-\nportantly, multiple reports have consistently demonstrated\nthat the frequency of MDR-associated SSI has increased\nglobally over the last decade [1, 6, 12] with low- and medium-\nincome countries (LMICs) reporting comparatively higher\nfrequencies [8, 11, 13]. In Eritrea, a recent multicenter study\nnoted that the frequency of HA-MRSA in hospitalized pa-\ntients with wound infections was 72% [14]. Altogether,\nexisting data suggest a highly heterogeneous picture with\nsigniﬁcant intra- and intercountry variation potentially\nreﬂecting the multiplicity of infection control practices (or\nlack thereof) and antimicrobial prescription patterns within\nthe region [1, 9].\nAlthough the signiﬁcance of gathering accurate data on\nresistance to antibacterial agents is well recognized, the\nproblem is largely underinvestigated and/or underreported\nin LMICs in SSA. For instance, obtaining adequate country-\nspeciﬁc data on multiple facets of SSI is diﬃcult despite the\nrapid expansion in facilities oﬀering complex surgical\nprocedures in urban and rural settings in SSA. And where\ndata exists, it is often suboptimal/partial or conﬂicting. In\nEritrea, data on the antimicrobial proﬁles of GNB or SSIs are\nlacking in international literature. In this regard, the true\ncaseload of hospital-acquired SSIs in Eritrea is largely\n"

To illustrate, the country has no\ninfrastructure of trained infection-control professionals and\nlacks a laboratory-based surveillance and reporting system.\nInternment of multiple patients (often in close proximity) in\nsingle wards also limits the utility of contact precaution\nprocedures. Moreover, antimicrobial therapy is infrequently\nguided by laboratory-generated drug susceptibility results or\nantibiotic stewardship programs.\n+erefore, this study was designed to collect data on the\nspectrum of bacteria associated with SSIs in two referral\nhospitals in Eritrea. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance patterns\nwere also proﬁled. Understanding the overall epidemiology\nof SSI from a local standpoint may be useful in guiding SSIs\ntherapy\nand\ninfection-control\ninterventions\nsuch\nas\nscreening and contact precautions, among others. +e study\nmay also provide crucial data on the magnitude of the\nproblem in the country.\n"

In this study, the most\ncommon isolates included Citrobacter spp. (25.4%), Kleb-\nsiella spp. (15.87%), Escherichia coli (12.7%), Proteus spp.\n(12.7%), Salmonella spp. (12.7%), Enterobacter spp. (7.94%),\nand Acinetobacter spp. (3.17%).

In contrast, the\ndominant Gram-positive isolate was Staphylococcus aureus.\nBeyond the current results, the normal ﬂora nature of some\nof these isolates on skin and mucosal surfaces along with the\nacquisition of diverse extraintestinal virulence factors and\nAMR mechanisms provides possible justiﬁcation for their\nemergence as a threat to postoperative and ICU patients.\nIn vitro analysis of AMR in multiple GNBs noted a high\nlevel of resistance to commonly used antibiotics like am-\npicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline.\nResistance of speciﬁc isolates to cefalexin, ceftriaxone, and\nceftazidime was also high. To illustrate, the E coli isolated in\nthis study were 100% resistant to ampicillin and >80%\ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,\ntetracycline,\ncefalexin,\nceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. High resistance (>80%) to\nmultiple antibiotics (ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and cef-\ntriaxone) was also observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae iso-\nlates. +is result is in harmony with some reports from the\nregion [21]. Sensitivity of the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates\nto amikacin and ciproﬂoxacin was also high. Furthermore,\nthe isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 100% resistant to\nnitrofurantoin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime.\nHigh level of resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-\nsulfamethoxazole was also noted in this isolates. Another\natypical outcome observed in this study was the high re-\nsistance of most isolates to nitrofurantoin—an antibiotic\nindicated for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and for pro-\nphylactic use in recurrent UTI. An explanation for this\noutcome is unclear.\nA number of issues are notable from these results. On the\nwhole, the extensive postprocedural contamination of sur-\ngical sites by enterobacterial isolates is concerning. In\nparticular, the high proportion of third-generation cepha-\nlosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (G3CREC) should raise\nconcern, given its potential for pathogenicity [22]. +is\nobservation is consistent with previous studies in SSA, which\nhave repeatedly noted that the frequency of G3CREC in the\nregion is disproportionately high [23–25]. Emphasizing\nthese concerns, a recent report noted that resistance to\ncephalosporins are increasing among nosocomial and\ncommunity-acquired strains of GNBs worldwide [4] and\nthat the high BoD associated with these strains (including\nG3CREC) will inevitably increase [22].\nMultiple\ndrivers\nof\nthe\nprojected\nincrease\nexist.\nAccording to some reports, imprudent antibiotic use and\npoor adherence to infection-control practices are the key-\nstone issues [26]. In SSA, these fundamental issues are\npoorly documented. In Eritrea for instance, there are no\nreports on the level of compliance by hospitals/healthcare\nworkers to transmission-based control guidelines such as\nactive surveillance to identify colonized patients and\nworkers, decolonization of patients and healthcare workers,\nenvironmental decontamination or the widespread use of\nrub-in hand disinfection techniques. Research on the ef-\nfectiveness of infection control practices (decontamination,\ndisinfection, and sterilization) is particularly lacking. An-\nother driver of the observed outcome is the extensive in-\nstitutional use of cephalosporins in preoperative antibiotic\n"

A foremost concern is the fact that the\nprocedures commonly used to detect vancomycin-inter-\nmediate S. aureus (VISA) strains or VRSA in the regions\nhave some limitations. More importantly, detection of these\nisolates should be conﬁrmed by a reference method—a\nprocess that was not performed in this study. Regardless, we\nhave to highlight the fact that the ﬁnding corroborates\nprevious reports [17] and aligns with several studies in the\nregion [12–14]. In this regard, it reinforces our previous\nargument that VRSA is more prevalent in parts of East\nAfrica (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan) compared with southern\nparts of Africa [14, 33]. More importantly, these preliminary\nresults highlight the need for the adoption of better testing\nprocedures for VISA or VRSA in the country.\n"

However, the study had\nseveral limitations including failure to perform anaerobic\nculture and molecular characterization of the isolates. An-\nother notably ﬁnding which should be treated with a lot of\ncaution is the high resistance to vancomycin. Regarding this\nconcern, we have to emphasize the fact that the disk dif-\nfusion procedure used in this study or in most studies from\nthe region has limitations in detecting resistance and that\ndetection of these isolates should be conﬁrmed by a refer-\nence method. In addition, sensitivity to speciﬁc drugs such as\nlinezolid, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenems (e.g.,\nimipenem), among others, was not evaluated.\n"
