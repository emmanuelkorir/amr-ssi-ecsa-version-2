Though CoNS can cause \ninfections, especially in immunocompromised patients, they are typically considered skin \ncontaminants [30, 31]. If we disregard CoNS, 86.7% of all potential pathogens isolated were gram-\nnegative. The high proportion of gram-negative bacteria could be the result of antibiotic selection \npressure from pre- and post-cesarean ampicillin administration, disproportionately killing gram-\npositive bacteria. Apart from CoNS, the most common pathogens isolated were A. baumanii, Proteus \nspp., K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. These bacteria are often associated with nosocomial infections \nand high morbidity [32, 33], potentially indicating a nosocomial source of SSI. Although not a \ntraditional pathogen in SSIs, recent studies have reported Acinetobacter as a cause of SSIs in resource-\nlimited settings [17, 34–37]. Moreover, third generation cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, are a \nknown risk factor for developing Acinetobacter infection, which 4.3% of study participants received \n"

As a result, 66 participants were unable to attend the scheduled study clinic on \nPOD 11, leading to a slightly reduced study population. Another limitation is that the postoperative \nantibiotic use may be inaccurately assessed as adherence to prescriptions was not measured. \nFurthermore, participants may have also used non-prescribed antibiotics, potentially interfering \nwith microbiology culture results. The usefulness of wound cultures is also debated, as surgical sites \nare a non-sterile environment, and even when using semi-sterile techniques–as performed in our \nstudy–skin colonizers or wound contaminants may be sampled and misinterpreted as pathogens \n[39]. In this study, several likely non-pathogenic isolates were found, including Lactococcus, Kocuria, \nand CoNS, which could indicate that swabs were contaminated or that the true pathogen or site \nof infection was not accessed using an appropriate swabbing technique. Although all participants \ndiagnosed clinically with an SSI in our study had growth in microbiology cultures, there is a risk of \nfalse-negative culture results due to incorrect swab technique or prior antibiotic treatment [39]. \nMoreover, because of the need for bacteria to grow in culture and sub-culture before resistance \ntesting can be performed, results may take 36–48 hours to return, limiting their clinical utility at \nthis time [39]. Finally, in this study, five (0.6%) patients received a non-standardized POD 11 exam \nby a non-study GP due to unavailability of study GPs, and one patient (0.1%) left the clinic before \nbeing seen by the doctor. These aberrancies are unlikely to affect our main study findings since \nthey represent <1% of our results.\n"

However, the pathogens isolated, and AMR profiling results are similar to \nregional and tertiary-level hospitals in the region [17, 23, 28], suggesting that these findings are \nlikely generalizable to other contexts in the region. Secondly, this team studied SSIs in women who \nhad undergone c-sections, a patient group who, in comparison with the general population, may \nhave a lower HIV seroprevalence, diabetes, and other co-morbidities which would predispose to \nSSIs or AMR. However, as in other SSA countries, the majority of surgeries performed in Rwanda \nare c-sections, most of which occur at district hospitals.

    "text": "income countries were identified, but were similar to reports from urban and tertiary hospitals \nin SSA. Pathogens isolated from SSI swab cultures, which were predominantly gram-negative \nbacteria, differed from those most commonly reported from high-income countries. Findings \nof high rates of resistance to available antibiotics is consistent with the concerning global trend \ntowards highly resistant pathogens and lack of effective treatment options, especially in a resource-\nconstrained environment. Additional research is needed to determine risk factors contributing to \nthe high prevalence of gram-negative and resistant pathogens identified in order to guide context-\nappropriate care and mitigate infection risks. These data can inform the development of evidence-\nbased protocols for rational use of antibiotics in SSI prevention and treatment in rural Rwanda and \ncomparable settings.\n"
