    "text": "Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of severe surgical\nsite infections (SSI). The molecular epidemiology of MRSA is poorly documented in Ethiopia. This\nstudy is designed to determine the prevalence of MRSA and associated factors among patients\ndiagnosed with SSI. A multicenter study was conducted at four hospitals in Ethiopia. A wound\nculture was performed among 752 SSI patients. This study isolated S. aureus and identiﬁed MRSA\nusing standard bacteriology, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass\nSpectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and cefoxitin disk diffusion test. The genes mecA, femA, vanA, and\nvanB were detected through PCR tests. S. aureus was identiﬁed in 21.6% of participants, with 24.5%\nof these being methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and 0.6% showing vancomycin resistance. Using\nMALDI-TOF MS for the 40 methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, we conﬁrmed that 31 (77.5%) were\nS. aureus, 6 (15%) were Mammaliicoccus sciuri, and the other 3 (2.5%) were Staphylococcus warneri,\nStaphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The gene mecA was detected from 27.5%\n(11/40) of Staphylococci through PCR. Only 36.4% (4/11) were detected in S. aureus, and no vanA\nor vanB genes were identiﬁed. Out of 11 mecA-gene-positive Staphylococci, 8 (72.7%) were detected\nin Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections\nwere associated with the following risk factors: age ≥61 years, prolonged duration of hospital\nstay, and history of previous antibiotic use, p-values < 0.05. Hospitals should strengthen infection\nprevention and control strategies and start antimicrobial stewardship programs.\n"

    "text": "S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus are the major species of CoNS frequently isolated from\nclinical specimens [2]. Furthermore, Mammaliicoccus sciuri (previously called S. sciuri)\nis part of the normal ﬂora of goats and camels, and it is a rare opportunistic pathogen\nin humans [3]. S. aureus possesses a unique set of virulence factors, including toxins,\nenzymes, and metallophores, which enable it to survive extreme conditions, promote tissue\ncolonization, cause systemic infection, and evade the host’s immunity [4]. By utilizing\nmetallophores, this bacterium can sequester metal ions from its environment [5]. S. aureus\ninfections have previously been treated with beta-lactams, including penicillin and, later,\nmethicillin, as well as sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and macrolides [6]. However, antibiotic-\nresistant strains of S. aureus have developed due to repeated exposure to antibiotics, leading\nto an increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections globally. MRSA is one\nof the most causative pathogens of surgical site infections (SSIs), and it is a prevalent\nbacterium that frequently colonizes hospital environments and causes hospital-acquired\ninfections [6] and community-acquired infections [7].\nMRSA is characterized by resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems,\nwith the exception of the new anti-MRSA cephalosporins ceftaroline and ceftobiprole an-\ntimicrobial agents [6,8]. The main mechanism of resistance is an altered penicillin-binding\nprotein (PBP2a/c) encoded by the mecA gene [1]. The mecA gene is regarded as the gold\nstandard for identifying isolates of MRSA, and it is a helpful marker. It is highly con-\nserved in staphylococcal strains and acquired through horizontal gene transfer. mecA is\ncarried/located on the mobile genetic element staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC)\nmec, and it codes for the low-afﬁnity PBP2a [9]. Other chromosomal factors, such as the\nhigh-level expression of femA and femB, also seem to be essential for high-level methi-\ncillin resistance [10]. The current treatment options for more serious MRSA infections\nrequiring hospitalization include parenteral antimicrobials, such as teicoplanin, tigecy-\ncline, linezolid [8], trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, daptomycin [6], and\nvancomycin [8]. However, the majority of MRSA strains are capable of evolution and have\nacquired resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including those listed above [9,11].\nVancomycin resistance in MRSA was ﬁrst discovered in 1996 in Japan following a few\nyears of commercializing the antibiotic [12]. Vancomycin resistance is acquired through\nmutations and cell wall modiﬁcation [12,13] mediated by a vanA gene cluster that can\nbe acquired from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) [11] through mobile genetic\nelements like transposonTn1546 [14]. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) infections are\ntreated with antibiotics like tigecycline, quinupristin, daptomycin, ceftobiprole, iclaprim,\nlinezolid, and new glycopeptides (telavancin, oritavancin, and dabavancin) [15].\nGlobally, the prevalence of VRSA was 16% in Africa, 1% in Europe, 3% in South\nAmerica, 4% in North America, and 5% in Asia [16]. A systematic review and meta-analysis\nrevealed a highly variable prevalence of VRSA and MRSA in Ethiopian S. aureus isolates.\nThe MRSA prevalence ranged from 8.3% to 77.3% (with a pooled prevalence of 32.5%) [17].\nIn the same way, there was a 5.1% to 44.3% variation in VRSA prevalence. [18]. These\ndays, MRSA is considered a serious threat to public health, and it is one of the pathogens\nthat needs to be treated with high priority. However, the molecular epidemiology of\nMRSA and VRSA is less well documented in Ethiopia, and published reports on MRSA-\nand VRSA-causing SSIs are scarce. Furthermore, almost all earlier reports depend on\nphenotypic laboratory methods. Therefore, in this study, we used the Matrix-Assisted Laser\nDesorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technique for\nthe conﬁrmation of bacterial isolates and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for\nthe detection of mecA, femA, vanA, and vanB.\n"

    "text": "MRSA is one of the primary bacteria responsible for surgical site infections [19]. The\nbacteria are human commensals [20], and they can cause a variety of infections, including\nsimple skin and wound infections; they can also infect visceral organs. If not diagnosed and\ntreated properly, many of these illnesses can quickly become life-threatening diseases [1].\nIn our study, among the 752 wound swab samples processed, we detected 21.7%\n(163/752) of S. aureus phenotypically. The present ﬁnding is similar to previous studies\nreported from Jimma Ethiopia (23.6%) [21] and Brazil (20%) [22]. On the other hand, this\nﬁnding is lower than those of studies conducted in other parts of Ethiopia, such as Dessie\n(34.5%) [23] and Debre Markos (39.7%) [24]. The variation in prevalence between studies\nmight be due to variations in the study subjects, the conducted time, and the method\nemployed for the detection of S. aureus [25].\nThe proportion of MRSA among the isolates based on disc diffusions was 24.5%\n(40/163). This study’s ﬁndings were similar to a previous study conducted in an Indian\nHospital (21.7%) [26]. On the other hand, the ﬁnding showed higher frequency than\nearlier studies in Ethiopia from Dessie (9.8%) [23] and Debre Markos (13.2%) [24], but\nit was below the national pooled prevalence estimate of Ethiopia (32.5%) [17], Addis\nAbaba (68.4%) [27], Arba Minch (82.3%) [28], and Nigeria (44%) [29]. Variations in MRSA\nprevalence across countries are inﬂuenced by demographics, antibiotic prescription policies,\ninfection prevention and control programs, staff and elderly hygiene education, healthcare\nsystem structure, and MRSA diagnostic facilities [30,31].\nFrom those tested for vancomycin resistance, one isolate had a minimum inhibitory\nconcentration for vancomycin greater than 8 µg/mL, and it was identiﬁed as a vancomycin-\nresistant Staphylococcus. This result was consistent with Pournajaf et al.’s [32] ﬁnding that\nvancomycin resistance was 2.5%, and this ﬁgure was lower than that from a review from\nEthiopia, where the pooled prevalence of VRSA was 5.3% [17], as well as the ﬁndings from\nDebre Markos (14.1%) [33] and elsewhere (29.4%) [34].\nFrom all methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, the mecA gene was carried by 27.5% of\nthe isolates. This ﬁnding was comparable with a study from Nigeria, where 30.5% of\nthe isolates carried the mecA gene [29]. In the present study, 12.9% of S. aureus carried\n"

    "text": "the mecA gene, which is lower than studies reported in Ethiopia (20%) [35], Bangladesh\n(25%) [36], Nigeria (38%) [29], and Iran (45.1%) [32]. It should be noted that the majority of\nisolates exhibiting the mecA gene were discovered in Debre Tabor. Eight (72.7%) of the ten\nmecA-positive isolates were detected at Debre Tabor Hospital. The reason might be poor\nsocioeconomic status, personal demographics, antibiotic prescription practice, and infection\ncontrol practices, which are associated with increased MRSA infection rates [30,31].\nIn our present study, the femA gene was detected in all S. aureus isolates, except two\ncefoxitin-resistant strains (6.7%). This ﬁnding was comparable with a study from China [37].\nAdditionally, in the present study, the femA gene was found in S. haemolyticus, S. warneri,\nand 83.3% of M. sciuri cefoxitin-resistant strains. On the other hand, neither mecA nor\nfemA were detected in S. epidermidis [37]. The primers used should be speciﬁc to S. aureus;\ntherefore, it is somewhat surprising that the two S. aureus lack the gene and that several\nother non-aureus isolates carry the gene. The explanation could be mutational changes in\nS. aureus and gene transfer to other species. All of these isolates have been sent for whole\ngenome sequencing, and this matter will be analyzed further when the results are ready.\nIt is interesting that a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of CoNS isolates harbour methi-\ncillin resistance genes, where 83.3% of M. sciuri and 50% of S. haemolyticus carried the mecA\ngene. This is in agreement with early reports that CoNS were the most common species in\nnosocomial infections and exhibit higher antibiotic resistance rates than S. aureus. This may\nbe explained by the high prevalence of methicillin resistance linked with staphylococcal\ncassette chromosome (SCCmec) elements in CoNS [38], and they are considered a major\nreservoir of SCCmec [39]. For instance, Berglund et al. described the likely transfer of\na type V SCCmec from methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus to MSSA, thus transforming\ninto MRSA [9,40]. Another study revealed that the mecA homologue in M. sciuri may be\nan evolutionary precursor to MRSA pathogenic strains, highlighting the main routes of\nantibiotic resistance gene transfer [41]. Furthermore, the report demonstrated that MSSA\nbecome MRSA by acquiring SCCmec from S. epidermidis through horizontal transfer [42].\nThese accounts suggest that horizontal interspecies transfer of mobile genetic elements\ncould be a crucial element for MRSA global dissemination [40,41,43].\nThe absence of the mecA and vanA genes in the MRSA and VRSA samples does not\nimply the absence of resistance, as resistance may be due to other mutations or cassette-\ncontaining resistance genes [44]. Globally, resistant staphylococcal isolates lacking the\nmecA gene show the possibility for additional mechanisms to compete with mecA in the\nestablishment of MRSA [45,46]. MRSA’s resistance against beta-lactams and methicillin is\nfurther complicated by its ability to develop resistance to vancomycin through accidental\ntransmission of the vanA gene from Enterococcal strains [47]. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide\nantibiotic that prevents the formation of the peptidoglycan layer by binding to the peptide\nprecursor. Antibiotic overuse leads to bacterial resistance, thus prompting the search for\nnew antimicrobial strategies [48]. Genomics can identify antibiotic targets, and live non-\nmultiplying bacteria can be targeted for new antibacterials, potentially resulting in new\nantibacterials that shorten therapy microorganisms, reduce adverse effects, and potentially\nreduce antibacterial resistance [49]. Preclinical research explores metal uptake via bacterial\nmetallophores [48]. Bacteriophages have been demonstrated to be antibacterial in animals\nthat are susceptible to certain infectious diseases [49].\nIn the present study, the likelihood of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus SSI in-\ncreased among patients aged ≥61 years (p = 0.025, AOR = 3.729 (1.179–11.791)). Similar\nﬁndings have been reported in Brazil [22]. Previous studies have suggested that patients on\nantibiotics (p = 0. 017), who had a previous wound infection (p = 0.006), and with a hospital\nstay > 72 h showed an association with MRSA infection [33]. Similarly to our ﬁnding,\nprevious use of antibiotics (p = 0.025, AOR = 3.066 (1.101–9.392)) and preoperative hospital\nstays > 7 days (p = 0.000, AOR = 1.856 (0.688–5.311)) demonstrated an association with\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococci for SSI. Unlike our study, a report by X. Yang et al. [50]\nshowed that long, invasive procedures used in the ICU, such as tracheal intubation and\n"
