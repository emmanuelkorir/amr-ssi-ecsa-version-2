    "text": "Abstract \nBackground:  Globally, surgical site infections are the most reported healthcare-associated infection and common \nsurgical complication. In developing countries such as Ethiopia, there is a paucity of published reports on the micro-\nbiologic profile and resistance patterns of an isolates.\nObjective:  This study aimed at assessing the bacterial profile and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates \namong patients diagnosed with surgical site infection at Jimma Medical Center in Ethiopia.\nMethods:  A prospective cohort study was employed among adult patients who underwent either elective or emer-\ngency surgical procedures. All the eligible patients were followed for 30 days for the occurrence of surgical site infec-\ntion (SSI). From those who developed SSI, infected wound specimens were collected and studied bacteriologically.\nResults:  Of 251 study participants, 126 (50.2%) of them were females. The mean ± SD age of the patients was \n38 ± 16.30 years. The overall postoperative surgical site infection rate was 21.1% and of these 71.7% (38/53) were \nculture positive. On gram stain analysis, 78% of them were Gram-negative, 11.5% were Gram-positive and 10.5% were \na mixture of two microbial growths. Escherichia coli accounted for (21.43%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa \n(19.05%), Proteus species (spp.) 14.29%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.90%), Klebsiella species (11.90%), Citrobacter spp. \n(9.5%), streptococcal spp. (7.14%), Coagulase-negative S. aureus (CoNS) (2.38%)\nConclusion:  Gram-negative bacteria were the most dominant isolates from surgical sites in the study area. Among \nthe Gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli were the most common bacteria causing surgical site infection. As there is \nhigh antibiotic resistance observed in the current study, it is necessary for routine microbial analysis of samples and \ntheir antibiogram.\nKeywords:  Antimicrobial susceptibility, Bacterial isolates, Surgical site infection, Ethiopia\n"

    "text": "procedure) and affects either the incision or deep tis-\nsue at the site of the surgery [2]. These infections can be \nsuperficial or deep incisional infections, or infections \naffecting organs or body spaces. SSIs are the most com-\nmon infections associated with health care settings. \nThey are associated with significant morbidity and over \none-third of postoperative deaths have been reported \nto be linked to SSI [3, 4]. SSI will double the duration of \na patient’s hospital stay and therefore increase the cost \nof health care [4]. Depending on the type of surgery \nand the severity of the infection, extra costs due to SSI \nof between 800 and £ 7000 have been recorded [5, 6].\nContamination of wound site and pathogenicity of \nmicroorganisms, balanced against the host’s immune \nresponse will determine the occurrence of SSI [7–9]. \nThe organism which causes SSI—are usually derived \nfrom the endogenous environment, that is the patient \nskin or opened viscus). Surgical instrument or theatre \nenvironment will contaminate the site during opera-\ntion leads to exogenous causes of SSI [2, 10, 11]. Hema-\ntogenous spread of organisms from distant sources \nof infection can rarely cause SSI by attachment to the \nprosthesis or other implant left in the operative site. \nThe infection prevention and control practices of SSI \nare therefore aimed at minimizing the number of path-\nogens at surgical site [12, 13].\nThe most common microorganism cultured from \nSSIs is Staphylococcus aureus [14–16]. When a viscus, \nsuch as the large bowel, is opened, tissues are likely to \nbe contaminated by numerous organisms. For exam-\nple, Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes can cause SSI \nafter colorectal surgery [11]. The presence of a foreign \nbody from prosthetic surgery reduces the number of \npathogenic organisms required to cause SSI [17, 18]. \nMicroorganisms, which are non-pathogenic such as \nStaphylococcus epidermidis, may also cause SSI in such \nenvironment. The type of wound also dictates the pres-\nence of microorganisms at surgical sites. For instance, \noperations on sterile sites have less than 2%, whereas, \nSSI will occur more than 10% after operations in “con-\ntaminated” or “dirty” sites [19, 20].\nResistance patterns of SSI-associated bacteria vary \nglobally, depending on the region, local epidemiology \nreports, and susceptibility testing methodology. Bac-\nterial resistances pose a challenge and complicated \nthe SSI treatment. Most of the data on drug resistance \nwere obtained from high-income countries [21, 22]. \nHowever, there were limited reports on the prevalence \nand incidence of resistant bacteria causing SSI, espe-\ncially from developing countries [21, 23]. Therefore, \nthis study aimed at assessing the bacterial profile and \nantimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates among \n"

Identification of bacterial pathogens and the \nselection of an effective antibiotic against the organ-\nism are essential in successful management of bacterial \ninfection. In the current study, the overall culture posi-\ntivity rate from patients with surgical site infection was \n71.7%, which was slightly higher than results previously \nreported from India (68%) [28], but lower than a report \nfrom Mekelle (75%) [29] and Nigeria (82%) [30]. Lower \nrates of positive culture were reported from India (50%) \n[31] and Nepal (63.3%) [16], Bangladesh (61.8%) [32].\nThe isolation rate of Gram-negative bacteria was \ngreater (78%) than Gram-positive bacteria (11.5%) in \nthis study. This, in contrast, to study done from Bang-\nladesh [32], and Nepal [33, 34]. This might be related to \nthe study population. In the latter studies, most of the \npatients were from the orthopedics department where \nGram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus and strep-\ntococcus are the main causative agents [35, 36]. The prev-\nalence of mixed infections in the current study (10.5%) \nwas lower than previous study from Jimma (22.9%) \n[37], Dessie (18.5%) [38] and Nigeria (33.2%) [39]. The \n"

A similar \nstudy finding from Gondar (Ethiopia) [43] reported that \nEscherichia coli a major isolate. However, this finding \nwas in contrast with many other studies [29, 35, 44–49]. \nIn these studies, authors have observed Staphylococcus \naureus as the commonest pathogen causing SSI in their \nrespective studies. The difference in the report might be \nexplained by the difference in the setting and study pop-\nulation. In the current study, most of the patients were \nfrom the general surgery ward. Most of the surgical pro-\ncedures performed were laparotomies and most wounds \nwere either clean-contaminated or contaminated, which \nhad spillage from the gastrointestinal tract. This might \nbe due to Escherichia coli’s natural habitat is the gas-\ntrointestinal tract.

    "text": "(100%), ciprofloxacin (67%), ampicillin (67%), cotri-\nmoxazole (67%) and chloramphenicol (67%) which \nagrees reports in other studies [37, 38]. In this study, \nmulti-drug resistance (MDR) to commonly used anti-\nbiotics was identified. Resistance to antibiotics ranged \nfrom 11.1% to 100%. Similarly, a study from Mekelle \n(Ethiopia) [29] showed a multi-drug resistance to the \ncommonly used antibiotics. In Tikur Anbessa spe-\ncialized Hospital [50], about 95% of the isolates were \nresistance to two or more antimicrobials while 82.3% \nof them were resistance to three or more antimicrobi-\nals. Besides these similar national studies, the current \nstudy findings were consistent with many other global \nstudies [4, 13, 29, 43, 45, 50, 51]. This might be because \nthese antibiotics are widely prescribed empirically for \nthe treatment of various infections in our setting.\nOverall, ceftriaxone resistance in this study was about \n78.79%. All pseudomonas and Proteus spp. isolated were \n100% resistant to ceftriaxone. This remarkably higher \nresistance might be the indiscriminate use of ceftriaxone \nas prophylaxis to all who underwent surgery in our hos-\npital. Even though, high drug resistance was observed by \nthis study meropenem was effective against Escherichia \ncoli which was the predominant cause of SSI in the cur-\nrent study. A high rate (nearly half) of bacterial resist-\nance against chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole was \nobserved. This is consistent with a study done in Saudi \nArabia [49]. This might be due to the indiscriminate use \nof antibiotics in both hospitals.\nIn this study, Citrobacter maximum resistance was \nconferred to cefepime (100%), ampicillin (75%), cipro-\nfloxacin (75%), ceftazidime (75%), cotrimoxazole (75%) \nand ceftriaxone (75%), which was comparable to the \nresult reported Girma et al. [37] in contrast another study \nreport 66.7% resistance for ampicilin [52]. The difference \nmight be due to the setting and included patients in the \nstudy. The consumption of cefepime in the study set-\nting is very low. Thus, the high resistance of Citrobacter \nto such antibiotics needs special attention, especially on \ntheir empirical use. Only one-third of streptococcus spp. \nisolates were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin, vanco-\nmycin, and clindamycin. This showed great concern for \nan infectious condition caused by these bacteria species \nsuch as pneumonia, meningitis. The rise in antibiotic \nresistance emphasizes the importance of sound hospital \ninfection control, rational prescribing policies, and the \nneed for new antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. In gen-\neral, the current study showed that the reported antibi-\notic susceptibility data was similar to the previous overall \nsusceptibility pattern of isolates in the study area [53–55]. \nHowever, some of the virulent bacteria such as P. aerugi-\nnosa, E. coli, and S. aureus showed increasing trends in \nresistance [56–58].\n"
