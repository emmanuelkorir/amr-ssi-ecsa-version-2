Box 7051, Kampala, Uganda\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nAbstract: Methicilline resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are becoming increasingly\nmultiresistant, and have recently developed resistance to vancomycin, which has been used \nsuccessfully to treat MRSA for many years. In-vitro determination of resistance patterns of S. aureus is\ncritical in terms of administering suitable antimicrobial treatments. The objective of this study was to \ndetermine the relative prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus isolates from surgical site infections and \ntheir antibiotic susceptibility pattern in Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. One hundred eighty\neight pus swabs were collected from patients with surgical site infections. Swabs were inoculated \nfor culture at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine, Makerere University. S. aurues\nisolates were identiﬁ ed using standard procedures and tested for oxacillin resistance according to \nmethods of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Out of the 188 specimens, 54 \n(28.7%) grew S. aureus. Seventeen (31.5%) of the S. aureus isolates were conﬁ rmed as MRSA by PCR.\nResistance rates of MRSA were 88.2% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 88.2% for erythromycin,\n58.8% for gentamycin, 70.6% for ciproﬂ oxacin, and 88.2% for chloramphenicol. All isolates were \nfound to be sensitive to vancomycin and clindamycin though the D-test was found to be positive \nin 82.4% of the isolates. In our region, although methicillin resistance increased in S. aureus strains,\nbecause of the unavailability and the high cost of alternative antibiotics, gentamycin is still suggested \nas an alternative for treatment of S. aureus infections. These results however indicate that vancomycin\nseemed to be the only antimicrobial agent effective against MRSA and it could be the drug of choice\nin treating multidrug resistant MRSA infection.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nKey words: Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic, methicilline, resistance, susceptibility, Uganda\n"

Recently, a substantial increase in the \nnumber of hospital infections due to MRSA \nhas been reported in many countries (Leclercq, \n2002; Kesah et al., 2003; Braun & Hassler, 2003).\nWe also found a high rate of MRSA isolates i.e. \n88.2% from the clinical specimens also showed\nmultiple drug resistance. In our study, MRSA \nisolates were resistant to most antibiotics tested. \nWe have observed in our study that resistance \nto different antibiotics among MRSA strains \nwas quite high.\nGentamycin, which was proposed to be \nan alternative therapy to MRSA infection, was \nfound to be still better in this part of the world \n(52.6%). This is perhaps due to the different \nclonal expansion and drug pressure in the \ncommunity. Another alternative to gentamycin\ntreatment of MRSA infections would\nbe\nclindamycin. However, due to cross resistance \nwith erythromycin for patients who\nhave\never been exposed to one drug, in this study,\nresistance was found to be high (82.4%).\n"

    "text": "constitutive mechanism encoded by theermgene\nby methylation of the 23S rRNA. Erythromycin\nhas been found to be an effective inducer, yet\nclindamycin a weak inducer. Therefore, clinical\nfailure may ensue when clindamycin therapy is\ninstituted on patients who have taken or have\nbeen exposed to erythromycin (Christine et al,\n2005). In this study all isolates of MRSA showed\nsensitivity to clindamycin. However, 82.4% of \nthem were actually having inducible resistance\nto clindamycin. Recently, in a similar study in\nTanzania clindamycin inducible resistance was\nobserved in 61% of MRSA (Mshana et al., 2009).\nAs high as 82% inducible clindamycin resistance\nhas been reported in Kwa-Zulu Natal in South\nAfrica (Shiitu & Lin, 2006).\nSince, complete eradication of MRSA\nmay not be possible, control of transmission\nseems to be the appropriate goal. The efﬁ cacy\nof some controlling methods are widely\nrecognized and recommended by most authors.\nThe ﬁ rst and the most effective way among\nthese are to avoid transmission through hand\ncontamination by the person responsible for\ncaring the infected patients. The use of broad-\nspectrum antibiotics for treating infections also\nincreases the rate of MRSA and other resistant\nbacteria (Vidhani et al., 2001). Some patients\ncan be treated with clindamycin, but inducible\nresistance may occur in some strains that\nappear susceptible in broth susceptibility tests.\nTherefore chemotherapy should be guided by\nsensitivity of the probable causative organism\nthrough accurate detection of MRSA by clinical\nlaboratories as well as making a D-test a routine\nprocedure. A further large study with a large\nsample should be carried out to ﬁ nd antibiotic\nsusceptibility of MRSA in various hospitals in\nthe East African region.\n________________\nReceived 16 May 2009\nRevised 23 June 2009\nAccepted 24 June 2009\n"
