    "text": "BACKGROUND: In low income countries, surgical site infections (SSIs) are costly and impose a \nheavy and potentially preventable burden on both patients and healthcare providers. This study aimed \nto determine the occurrence of SSI, pathogens associated with SSI, the antibiogram of the causative \npathogens and specific risk factors associated with SSI at the hospital. METHODS: Two hundred and \nsixty-eight respondents admitted for general surgical procedures (other than neurological and \ncardiothoracic surgeries) at the Aga Khan University Hospital were eligible to take part in the study. \nPost-surgery patients were observed for symptoms of infection. Follow ups were done through the \nconsulting clinics, breast clinic and casualty dressing clinic by a team of surgeons. In cases of \ninfection, pus swabs were collected for culture.  \nRESULTS: SSI incidence rate was 7.0%, pathogens isolated from SSI included gram negative enteric \nbacilli and S. aureus which was the most prevalent bacterial isolate. Only one isolate of MRSA was \nfound and all staphylococci were susceptible to Vancomycin. Preoperative stay ≥ 2 days and wound \nclass were the risk factors associated with SSI.  \nCONCLUSION: The SSI incidence rates (7.0%) observed in this study were relatively lower than the \nones documented in other studies in Kenya. S. aureus is the most prevalent pathogen associated with \nSSI. Similar to findings from other studies done in the region; prolonged hospital stay and dirty \nwounds were the risks associated with postsurgical sepsis at the hospital. \nKEYWORDS:  Surgical sites, Infection, Surveillance, Antibiotics \n \n"

The study revealed that \nPseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent \npathogen causing sepsis post-surgery followed \nclosely by Staphylococcus aureus. A study by \nKohli et al, in 2010 at the Aga Khan University \nHospital that also revealed S. aureus as the most \nprevalent organism also confirms the S. aureus \nhigh prevalence (23).  Additionally, findings \nshowed that infection occurred in all individuals \nirrespective of medical underlying condition. \nIntraoperative prophylaxis did not alter disease \noutcome as shown by the results. Varied SSI \noccurrence was noted on anatomical sites while \nabdominal and perineum surgery had the highest \nfrequency among other anatomical sites. \n  \nAlthough the numbers of microorganisms \nisolated in the study were low, the sensitivity \npattern revealed that the prevalence of MRSA \n(one (1) isolate) is low among the staphylococcus \nspecies isolated from SSI. Recent studies done at \nthe Aga Khan University Hospital further revealed \nthe absence of nasal carriage among the hospital \ncare-givers (24). The MRSA prevalence in this \nstudy is comparatively lower compared with the \nstudy findings by Brown et al., (12) in Russia and \nThu et al., (2006) in Vietnam (25).  \nThis study found out that wound class IV \nand preoperative stay ≥2 days were the risk factors \nassociated with SSI at the hospital. Different \nstudies in the world have associated SSIs to \ndifferent risk factors in varied settings.

Brown et al., (12), in Russia, in \nhis study reported that emergency operation, male \nsex, ASA classification greater than 2, wound \nclass greater than 2 and prolonged operation \nduration were significant predictors of SSI. Soleto \net al., (14), in Bolivia, reported that ASA scores, \nwound class, procedure duration and presence of \ndrains were significantly associated with SSI. The \nabove findings from different studies and settings \nidentified wound class as a common risk factor \nassociated with SSI which is similar to the \nfindings of this study. Prolonged preoperative \nhospital stay is frequently suggested as a patient \ncharacteristic associated with increased SSI risk. \nHowever, length of preoperative stay is likely a \nsurrogate factor for severity of illness and co-\nmorbid conditions requiring inpatient workup \nand/or therapy before operation (26). \nPus swabs are not ideal specimens for \nstudy of SSI according to CDC definitions; \nhowever, it was clinically not practical to obtain \nideal specimens from the study population due to \npatient acceptability and constrains of resources. \nAlthough the SSI was defined according to CDC \nprotocol, the SSIs were not stratified according to \nsuperficial, deep and organ space. All precautions \nwere taken to avoid skin contaminants. The lack \nof anaerobic culture system was additional \nlimitation.  \nIn conclusion, the SSI incidence rate \n(7.0%) observed in this study were relatively \nlower than the ones documented in other studies in \nKenya. S. aureus is the most prevalent pathogen \nassociated with SSI. Similar with the findings \nfrom other studies done in Kenya, prolonged \nhospital stays and dirty wounds were the risk \nassociated with postsurgical sepsis at the target \nhospital. \n  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nMy appreciation goes to the Aga Khan University \nHospital for hosting and providing partial funding \nto this study and to the Jomo Kenyatta University \nof Agriculture and Technology for the expertise \nsupport during the study. \n"
