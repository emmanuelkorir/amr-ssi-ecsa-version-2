The surgical\nprocedure determines the category of infection must\nappear [1].\nSSIs are the third common hospital acquired infection\nwhich accounts 38% of all nosocomial infections accord-\ning to center for disease control (CDC’s) national noso-\ncomial infection surveillance system [2].\nIn countries with limited resources, SSI is the foremost\ninfection in the overall patient population, affecting up\nto 66% of operated patients and nine times more than in\nindustrialized countries [3].\nIncrease hospital stays time, readmissions and additional\nuse of antimicrobials which lead to antibiotic-resistant\nwere seen by SSIs [4].On average, SSIs increased postoper-\native hospital stay by 6.5 to 11 days and 3.57 additional\ndrug uses [2, 4]. SSI increased cost in England from\n$1,341-10,922 per patient, in Europe € 3,985/day and in\nthe USA $25,546 per infection depending on surgery type\nand infection severity at institutional as well as national\nlevel [5, 6].\nStudy indicated that nearly 40-60% of SSIs can be pre-\nvented with the appropriate use of surgical antimicrobial\nprophylaxis (AMP) [7, 8]. Approximately 30-50% of anti-\nmicrobials used in hospitals are for surgical prophylaxis\nbut 30 -90% of them are used inappropriately [9, 10]\nwhich attribute for 16% of SSIs [8].\nAntimicrobials are a serious matter and resources are\nin short supply to prevent rise of resistance and limit the\ndegree of this problem in developing countries. Al-\nthough pathogens resistivity has increased, unfortu-\nnately, no new antimicrobials that can manage this\nresistance have been introduced and are not expected in\nthe future [11, 12]. World Health organization (WHO)\ndescribed as resistance to antimicrobials has been a main\nthreat to worldwide public health because there are few\nantimicrobials available to treat life-threatening infec-\ntions in some cases [13].\nUnnecessary extra costs, potential promotion of mi-\ncrobial resistance selection and a precious resource\nwastage in health care occur due to inappropriate use of\nAMP. Studies presented that the cost of inappropriate\nAMP is approximately 10 times higher than the values\nexpected [14, 15].\nGram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli are\nmajor causative organisms of SSI as described by multi\nand single centered studies [16, 17].\nDue to inadequate SSI surveillance programs in many\nof sub-sahara Africa, healthcare centers are unable to\nget an update on bacteria which is resistant to the anti-\nmicrobial [18]. In developing countries tests which\n"

The finding was\nhigher compared with studies done in USA 7.2% [26] and\nSaudi Arabia 6.8 % [27]. The difference might be due to\nmodern surgical techniques, surgery rooms and sufficient\ntrained professionals in developed countries.\nSmoking contributes to the development of SSI by caus-\ning vasoconstriction which results in tissue hypoxia and\nhypovolemia locally as well as systemically which delays\nthe healing progress, an environment conducive to SSI.

Similar findings have been documented\nin\nIndia\nwhere\nthe\nrate\nof\nSSI\nwas\nhigher\nin\nclean-contaminated wound (22.8%) compared to wound\nwhich are clean (15.1%) [28]. Also in study done in\nSudan the rate of SSI was higher in clean contaminated\n(9.5%) relative to clean wound (8%) [30]. The lesser rate\nof SSIs in clean wound in our study might be due to\nclose precaution was taken to clean wound and might\nalso be due to rational use of ceftriaxone for the most\nclean wound, which might result in sensitive strains in\nthe clean wound as indicated [31] and also our study\nconfirms that ceftriaxone is highly sensitive to suspected\norganisms in clean wound.\nThe prolonged operation is an independent factor for\nSSIs in other study because of higher risk for infection\ndue to incision of the operation site [32]. It also in-\ncreases the extent of tissue trauma due to an extensive\nsurgical procedure, long duration of anesthesia effect, in-\ncreased blood loss and also decrease surgical antimicro-\nbial prophylaxis concentration at tissue level which all\nincreases the risk of SSIs [25, 28]. In our study, patients\nwith duration of operation more than 1 hour were 2.13\ntimes more likely to develop SSI compared to patients\nwhose operation completed within 1 hour, [ARR = 2.13\n(95%CI(1.18-3.86),P= 0.012] which was in line with other\nstudy [33].\nAdministering AMP before 1 hour was observed to be\nan independent factor associated with SSIs in previous\nstudy [34]. In this study, AMP administration before 1\nhour increased SSIs risk by 5.05 times compared with\nadministration of first dose of surgical antimicrobial\nprophylaxis within 1 hour of skin incision [ARR =5.05\n(95% CI(1.79-14.21),P=0.002]. Antimicrobials concentra-\ntion is not sufficient enough at the action site in tissue,\nas well as in serum to avoid the contamination during\noperation until wound closure if the first dose of anti-\nmicrobial was administered 1 hour earlier. One study in-\ndicated that low antibiotic concentration in tissue at the\ntime of wound closure was an independent factor for the\ndevelopment of SSIs [35].\nConcerning to the causative agents, common cause of\nSSI were Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by Staphylo-\ncoccus aureus, Escherichia colli and Pseudomonas aeru-\nginosa. Most of the operations were caesarean section\n(CS) and appendectomy which were either clean or\nclean-contaminated. Our study suggested that the prob-\nable reason for the organisms to cause SSI was the\nspillage\nof\nthis\norganism\nfrom\nthe\nGIT.\nThe\naerobic-anaerobic organisms closely similar with the\nnormal endogenous flora of the operated organ like\nclean-contaminated surgery of CS constitutes the most\nidentified bacterial agents.\nGram-negative bacilli are the most common aerobic\nbacterial agents causing SSIs in CS patients and our\n"

A similar find-\ning has been documented with other studies conducted\nin Mbarara, Mulago and Tanzania [37–39].\nIn our study Klebsiella pneumoniae has high sensitivity\nto both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone but was resistant\nto ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. In line with\nour study, study conducted in Kenya showed that Kleb-\nsiella's resistant to ceftriaxone [40] and resistance to\nchloramphenicol was also reported in Uganda [41].\nOur study showed that ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, clox-\nacillin, and gentamycin were sensitive to Staphylococcus\naureus, but were resistant to erythromycin, chloram-\nphenicol, and ampicillin. This was in line with a study\ndone in Uganda [41]. The finding for ceftriaxone in our\nstudy is surprisingly indicated high sensitivity against\nboth Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms since\nthe drug is frequently prescribed to almost all patients\nwho underwent operation.\nThe result of this study will provide information for\nsurgeons, working organizations like Non-governmental\norganizations\n(NGOs)\nin\nhealth\ncare\nsystem\nof\nWUNEMMH as well as in national and international\nlevel to decrease the rate of SSI and related complica-\ntions with SSIs.\n"
