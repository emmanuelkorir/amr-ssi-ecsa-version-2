This study aimed to determine the incidence, bacteriological profile and predictors of \nSSIs following limb amputation at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) and Sekou Toure Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH).\nMethods  The longitudinal study was conducted among patients undergoing limb amputations between March and \nJuly 2024 at BMC and SRRH. Pre-tested structured questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic and clinical \ndata. Clinical diagnosis of SSI was done using CDC criteria followed by collection of wound or pus swab for culture \nand susceptibility testing. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modelling was done using STATA version 15.0 \nto assess associations between clinical variables and odds of SSI.\nResults  A total of 120 patients with a median (IQR) age of 58 [43.5–66.5] years were enrolled. The indications for \nlimb amputations included diabetic foot ulcers (50.8%,61/120), trauma (8.3%,10/120), malignancy (8.3%,10/120), \ngangrene (9.2%,11/120), peripheral vascular disease (16.7%,20/120) and congenital malformations (6.7%,8/120). The \nincidence of SSIs was (30%,36/120), with Escherichia coli (36.7%; 11/30) and Staphylococcus aureus (23%; 7/30) being \nthe most frequently isolated pathogens. More than half of the Gram-negative isolates were resistant to third and \nfourth generations cephalosporins which were commonly used as prophylactic antibiotics in the study settings. Age \nabove 65 years (OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05–0.95, p = 0.043), smoking (OR = 14.3, 95% CI: 1.33-10.00, p = 0.027), ASA Class III \n(OR = 13.33, 95% CI: 2.82–63.14, p = 0.001), longer surgery duration (≥ 2 h) (OR = 4.09, 95% CI: 1.30-12.89, p = 0.016) and \nblood transfusion (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 0.7-8.00, p = 0.02) were independently associated with SSIs.\nConclusion  About one third of the patients developed SSIs following limb amputation. Odds of SSIs were increased \nin patients with low age, smoking, high ASA score, prolonged surgery and who received blood transfusion. This \n"

Despite its devastat­\ning impact on patients and the families, limb amputation \nremains among the most commonly performed surger­\nies with approximately 185,000 surgeries performed \neach year worldwide [2]. Indications for limb amputation \ninclude trauma, musculoskeletal malignancies, diabetes, \ninfections, peripheral vascular disease, congenital mal­\nformations, sepsis, and burns [6, 7].\n"

    "text": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) have been reported to be \nthe most common complications following limb amputa­\ntion [1, 4, 8]. SSIs following limb amputation contribute \nsignificantly to patient morbidity and mortality, longer \nhospital stays, increased risk of readmission, revision sur­\ngery, higher treatment costs, and compromised health \noutcomes [4, 9]. Cumulative incidence of SSIs has been \nestimated to range from 13 to 48% following amputation, \nhowever SSIs rates as high as 57% has also been reported \nfollowing traumatic limb amputation [7, 10–12]. Previ­\nous studies from Tanzania reported different rates of \nSSIs, ranging from 19% in Kilimanjaro Christian Medi­\ncal College Centre(KCMC) to 35% in Muhimbili National \nHospital(MNH) [13, 14]. This variability, together with \nlimited publications, prompts further research into the \nmagnitude of the problem in various settings as well as \ntrends in SSIs following amputation over time. Previous \nstudies by Chalya et al. in 2012 [4] and Mawalla et al. in \n2011 [15] at BMC reported more than ten years ago dem­\nonstrated SSIs rates of 21.0% and 12.5% respectively fol­\nlowing limb amputations.\n"
