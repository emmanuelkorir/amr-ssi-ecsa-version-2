    "text": "Surgical site infections (SSI) remain a common postoperative complication despite use of prophylactic \nantibiotics and other preventive measures, mainly due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Here, \nwe present antimicrobial resistance rate of bacteria isolated in clinical cases of SSI. A hospital based \ndescriptive cross sectional study was conducted on 83 consented postoperative patients with clinical \nSSI. Data on patients was obtained using structured data collection form. Two swabs were collected \naseptically from each patient. Bacteriological culture examination and identification was done \nfollowing standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility test was done by Kirby-Bauer \ndisc diffusion method. Gram negative bacteria (GNB) were predominant (65.59%) with the dominant \nbeing Klebsiella species (29.03%). Overall 86% of aerobic bacteria isolated were multidrug resistant \n(MDR) where 65.63% and 96.72% of Gram positive and Gram negative isolates were MDR respectively. \nAll the isolates with exception of Enterococci species were resistant to ampicillin. GNB showed high \nresistance to ceftriaxone, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and gentamicin. All the isolated Klebsiella \nspp were MDR. S. aureus were all resistant to oxacillin. The isolation rate was higher in emergency, \nmales and dirty wounds in relation to nature of surgery, gender and class of surgical wound respectively. \nThese findings necessitate judicious antibiotic use and calls for surveillance of SSIs periodically as well as \nstrict adherence to good sanitation practice to reduce spread of drug-resistant pathogens.\n"

Contamination of the \nsurgical site by microorganisms occurs during surgical procedure or postoperative wound care settings. The sur-\ngical site can be contaminated from sources within the patient such as patient flora, remote infection; or external \nsources such as surgical personnel, physical environment and ventilation, and tools/equipment/materials in the \noperation theatre2,3.\nDespite use of prophylactic antibiotics pre- and postoperatively and other preventive measures such as \nimproved operating room ventilation, sterilization methods, use of barriers, surgical technique, SSIs still remain \na burden to postoperative patients4. This has majorly been attributed to increasing emergence of antimicrobial \nresistance5,6 due to irrational use of antibiotics. This inappropriate use of antimicrobials increases selection pres-\nsure favoring emergence of pathogenic drug resistant bacteria.\nThere is no data on the global epidemiology of SSI due to lack of standardized diagnosis, absence of surveil-\nlance and notification system in many developing countries4,7.

    "text": "reported in a systematic review9. SSI causes a marked health burden in terms of patient morbidity and mortality, \nprolonged hospitalization, increased cost of treatment to patients, increased resistance of microorganisms to \nantimicrobials, and a massive additional financial burden for health systems7,10. Information on burden of HAI \nis scanty in developing countries. In Uganda, it is reported that about 10% of the surgical procedures become \nseptic11. The incidence of SSI at Mbarara regional referral hospital (MRRH) in 2015 was revealed to be 16.4%12. \nMany studies in Uganda report the most common bacterial pathogens as E. coli, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter \nspecies, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus species, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter species6,12,13. The emer-\ngence of antimicrobial resistant strains of hospital pathogens has also presented a challenge in the provision of \ngood quality in-patient care. A study about antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens causing SSI conducted \nin a national hospital, Tanzania revealed that 63% of the isolates were multidrug resistance (MDR)14. While in \nUganda, a similar study conducted in the national hospital showed that MDR was reported to be 78% among the \nbacterial isolates of SSI6. At MRRH, number of patients with clinical SSI observed in surgical and gynecology \nwards is increasing yet data on the bacterial isolates causing SSI and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is \nlimited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the bacterial pathogens from hospital acquired surgical \nsite infection and determine their antimicrobial resistant patterns among postoperative patients at MRRH.\n"

    "text": "Discussion\nThe culture positivity of 81.93% in our study was higher compared to the isolation rate of 68.8% in a referral hos-\npital in Uganda6, 71% in Ethiopia15 and 60.6% in Nepal16. The high proportion in the present study was found to \nbe the result of persistent antimicrobial resistant pathogenic bacteria as discussed later. The proportion of culture \npositivity was comparatively high at 90% in Tanzania14 and 96% in India17. Generally, the possible variation in \nculture positivity could be attributed to differences in the infection control/prevention practices and differences \nin the population studied (comorbid illnesses, sex, age).\nIn this study there was 18.07% culture negativity, suggesting possibility of susceptible aerobes or anaerobe as \nshown by 13.33% bacteria seen on direct smear among the culture negatives. Anaerobic culture was not done in \nthis study. There is also possibility infection by other microbes other than bacteria.\nThe isolation rate was not significantly affected by gender (p-value = 0.354), being higher for males (86.21%) \ncompared to females (79.63%) which agrees with findings from other studies with males having more rates; 80.2% \nmales and 57.7% females, p < 0.00115, and 81.3% males and 64.9% females6. This could be due to a number of \nreasons including males being more exposed to risk factors like cigarette smoking which has been found to be \nassociated with increased SSIs rate1,18, males being mostly accident cases with increased colonisation of exposed \nwound and differences in adherence to treatment. Isolation in the present study was found to be higher in emer-\ngency procedures compared to elective (p < 0.0001) which complies with related studies17,19. The possible reason \nbehind this could be due to the fact that emergency surgeries being life saving procedures might compromise on \nthe level of aseptic techniques employed and possibility of prolonged complicated emergency cases which predis-\npose to inoculation of pathogenic microorganisms in surgical site. Isolation rate in the current study was found \nto be more in dirty wounds, followed by contaminated, clean-contaminated and clean (p < 0.0002). This concurs \nwith other studies17,19,20. This could be explained by the level of microbial load which is higher in contaminated \nwounds increasing chances of isolation.\nA total of 93 aerobic bacteria were isolated where more pure isolates (63.24%) were recovered than mixed \n(36.76%) which was in consistence with similar studies6,14–16, however, it was in contrast with a study in Italy \nwhere more mixed isolates were recovered compared to pure ones21. Class of surgical wound plays a role in the \npurity of the isolates where clean procedures are associated with monomicrobial isolates while contaminated \nand dirty wounds are associated with polymicrobial isolates17. Majority of the surgeries in this study were clean.\nThe preponderance of Gram negative bacteria in the current study was in agreement with findings from neigh-\nboring Tanzania and Ethiopia14,22. This could be attributed to diverse habitat of Gram negative bacteria including \ninanimate surfaces in hospitals, multidrug resistant patterns portrayed and possible contamination from intesti-\nnal tract during surgery. Klebsiella species was the predominant isolate which contrasts with similar studies that \nreported S. aureus as the predominant isolate13,15,19,23. Klebsiella species have been reported common contami-\nnants in operating room air and fomites including medical equipments in hospitals24. Others studies reported \nP. aeruginosa (not isolated in this study) as the dominant isolate14,16. Species and proportion of isolated bacteria \nvary according to the place and year. The posible reason for variation in the species isolated could be attributed to \ndifferences in aseptic techniques followed, diverse geographical distribution of causative agents, varied resistant \npatterns of the bacterial isolates in question, and difference in the surgical procedures performed among other \nreasons. When internal organs are resected through the abdomen, the causative agents included the normal Gram \nnegative flora of the gut and in clean procedures, exogenous bacteria or skin colonizers are recovered17.\nIn this current study, in vitro antibiotic susceptibility to the commonly used drugs showed that the bacterial \nisolates responded differently to the tested antibiotics. With exception of Enterococci species all Gram positive \nbacteria were resistant to ampicillin. The reason behind this could be the irrational use of ampicillin, which was \none of the most used antibiotics for empiric prophylaxis. Similar results of complete resistance (100%) by Gram \npositives to ampicillin were reported in India17 and North West Ethiopia25. Ciprofloxacin was seemingly the drug \nof choice for the Gram positives according to our study.

    "text": "Uganda and elsewhere reported a high resistance (90–97%) by the Gram negative bacterial isolates to ampicil-\nlin13,15,19,25. Klebsiella species showed high resistance to ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, \ngentamicin and moderate resistance to ciprofloxacin and it was in agreement with similar studies in Ethiopia and \nIndia15,17. But in contrast, a study in Uganda reported that Klebsiella species had 100% sensitivity to gentamicin13. \nE. coli showed high resistance (78–100%) to antibiotics tested, similar to findings from a study in India17 while \nother studies show moderate resistance (40–60%)15,25. Among the Proteus species, there was moderate resistance \nto ciprofloxacin but high resistance to other antibiotics tested, which was in contrast to study in Ethiopia15 where \nthere was low resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, gentamicin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. In this \nstudy MDR was observed to be 86% which was comparable to the 78% reported in Uganda6 but much higher \nthan the 63% described in Tanzania14. Microorganisms from the hospital environment are exposed to various \nantimicrobial agents and have been shown to express high antimicrobial resistance due to selection pressure26,27 \nhence posing difficulty in the therapeutic management of such hospital-acquired infections. Resistance to the \ncommonly used antibiotics could also be attributed to the injudicious use of the antibiotics by clinicians without \nevidence of causative agent and antibiogram, and misuse resulting from self-treatment with the readily available \nand cheap over-the-counter antibiotics. The high antibiotic resistance in this study implies that the available \nantibiotics might be rendered useless if immediate action is not taken and calls for stringent measures on antimi-\ncrobial stewardship as well as search of new antibiotics.\nWe certainly had limitations in the study including inability to isolate causative agents of SSI other than aero-\nbic bacteria such as strict anaerobes and fungi due to inadequate funds which could have increased the positivity \nrate. We only included in our susceptibility test the commonly used antibiotics in the study site.\nIn conclusion, SSI is still a major problem in postoperative patients in the study site. There was an alarming \nMDR rate of 86% among the bacterial isolates and high resistance to the commonly used antibiotics. We strongly \nrecommend that antibiotic therapy should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. We recommend \nsurveillance of SSIs periodically including incidence, aetiology, antibiotic susceptibility profile and source of \ninfection. We suggest a preoperative rectal swab to detect colonization with MDR bacteria in order to isolate \naffected patients and avoid wasteful usage of antibiotics. Finally, we recommend strict adherence to good sani-\ntation practice including thorough hand washing, disinfection of inanimate objects and other infection control \nmeasures so as to minimize the spread of MDR strains of bacteria.\n"

With exception of Chocolate agar that was incubated in increased \ncarbon dioxide, all other inoculated agar plates were incubated aerobically at 35–37 °C for 24 hr. The plates were \nfurther re-incubated for up to 48 hours in case of no growth after 24 hours. The second swab was used for direct \nGram staining to make a presumptive diagnosis. Identification of isolates was done using combination of colo-\nnial characteristics, Gram staining characteristics and conventional standard biochemical tests. Analytical profile \nindex, API20E (BioMérieux) was used to retest bacterial isolates in cases where conventional identification meth-\nods could not identify the isolates.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing for the isolated pathogen was performed using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion \nmethod according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)29. About 2–3 isolated colonies selected \nfrom a pure culture of blood agar plate were mixed in a tube containing 5 ml sterile saline to form a homogenous \nsuspension. The suspension was adjusted to achieve a turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standards using a \nphotometric device (Densimat, BioMérieux). Within about 15 minutes, a sterile cotton swab was dipped into \nthe adjusted suspension and the excess fluid removed. The dipped swab was evenly inoculated on the surface \nof Müller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, Ltd, England) by streaking in three different planes rotating the plate approxi-\nmately 60° each time and then the rim of the plate swabbed once. Selected antibiotic discs were place aseptically \non the surface of the inoculated media after 5 minutes using sterile pair of forceps. The under listed BD BBL \nSensi-Discs were used: Ceftriaxone (30 µg), Ciprofloxacin (5 µg), Gentamycin (10 µg or 30 µg), Sulfamethoxazole/\nTrimethoprim (25 µg), and Ampicillin (10 µg) for both Gram positive and negative bacteria, and Erythromycin \n(15 µg) and Oxacillin (1 µg) for Gram positive bacteria. Gentamycin (30 µg) was used for Enterococcus species to \ndetect aminoglycoside resistance. The antibiotic discs were selected based on the availability and prescription \nfrequency at the study site and CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2012). The plates were inverted and incubated aerobically \n"
