    "text": "Introduction \n \nDespite the progress made with respect to infection control and \nwound management, wound infection still remains a serious and \nsignificant clinical challenge particularly in developing countries \nwhere wound site infections are a major source of post operative \nillness, a cause of death among burn patients [1] and accounts for \napproximately a quarter of all nosocomial infections [2]. These \ninfections have resulted in increased trauma in patient, prolonged \nhospitalization, \nincreased \nhospital \ncost \nas \ngeneral \nwound \nmanagement practices become more resource demanding.  \n  \nThe progression of a wound to an infected state involves a \nmultitude of factors including old age, repeated trauma, blood \nperfusion, immune suppression and coexisting morbidity all of which \nimpair wound healing, increasing the risk of infection. Other risk \nfactors reported include gender, surgical technique, lifestyle, \nhospitalisation which increases risk of infection by drug resistant \norganisms, and length of operation [3]. The type, site, size, and \ndepth of the wound and the combined level of virulence expressed \nby the types of microorganisms involved have also been reported to \nfacilitate wound infection [4]. Therefore, knowledge of risk factors \nassociated with infections could help strengthen efforts to reduce \ntheir occurrence, thus reducing morbidity and mortality for these \ninfections.  \n  \nThe control and management of infection is a complex and \nimportant aspect of wound care. Although antibiotics have been of \ngreat value in treatment and in prophylaxis to prevent infections, \nthe timing of administration, choice of antimicrobial agent, durations \nof administration have clearly defined the value of antibiotics in \nreducing wound infections [2]. Even though treatment especially in \nlife-threatening situations is usually empiric employing broad-\nspectrum antibiotics, increasing rates of antibiotic resistance among \npathogens have been a major impediment to the success of empiric \ntreatment, resulting in treatment failure hence increasing treatment \ncost. In addition, the spectrum of pathogens circulating in any \nhealth care setting has been shown to change with time and even \nbetween various departments [5]. Thus routine surveillance for \npathogens and their susceptibility to antibiotics is of paramount \nimportance not only to reinforce strategies for successful wound \ninfection control and management but in the control of antibiotic \nusage to stem the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. \nComprehensive data on aetiology of infected wounds in Buea and \ntheir antibiotic susceptibility patterns as well as risk factors for \ninfection are lacking. Ndip et al. [6-8] and Nkwelang et al. [9] \ncharacterized specific pathogens recovered from wound swabs and \nother clinical specimens in healthcare settings in Buea. Here, we \nreport findings from a study conducted to determine the risk factors \nfor infection, the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of \nbacterial pathogens in various wound types. The study is important \nto generate findings that would guide the strengthening of policies \non infection control, empiric antibiotic treatment and control of \nantibiotic use.  \n  \n  \nMethods \n \nStudy setting, design and data collection  \n  \nThis study was carried out in Buea, a cosmopolitan town situated on \nthe eastern slopes of Mount Cameroon. The climate in Buea tends \nto be humid, with the neighbourhoods at higher elevations enjoying \ncooler temperatures while the lower parts experience a hotter \n"

Although Buea has a population of about 200,000 \ninhabitants, there is an expected rapid annual increase in population \nsize since Buea hosts the first Anglo-Saxon University in Cameroon \nand many other institutions of higher learning. Provision of health \ncare in Buea as in other parts of the country is a joint effort of the \npublic and the private sector, the bulk burden is borne by the public \nsector which is non-profit making and subsidizing health care cost. \nThis has attracted a good patient turn out, making public hospitals \nthe major health care providers. The private sector comprises \nindividuals and religious organizations. Two health care facilities \nparticipated in this study: Mount Mary Health Center and the \nRegional Hospital Anex. Mount Mary Health Centre is a private \nhealth care facility with a Surgical Department of 46 bed capacity. \nThe Regional Hospital Annex from where the majority of study \nparticipants were recruited is government-owned and has a Surgical \nDepartment with a capacity 50 beds. All patients with septic wounds \nduring the period October 2010 to March 2011 were sampled. \nWound swabs from different anatomical sites of hospitalized \npatients clinically diagnosed with wound infection were collected \njust before wound dressing. Microbiological characteristics of swab \nspecimens from burns, ulcer, open wounds and post operative \nwounds were analyzed and their susceptibility to commonly \nprescribed antibiotics tested. Data were recorded on age, sex, and \nwound type. Information on co-existing morbidity including diabetes \nand HIV status of patients was obtained from patients ' records. \nOnly patients who gave consent to participate in the study were \nenrolled. Ethical approval of the study was obtained from the \nmanagement boards of participating hospitals as well as from the \nRegional Delegation of Public Health for the South West Region.  \n  \nSample collection  \n  \nSwabs were collected from wounds during dressing before the \nwound was cleaned using an antiseptic solution. A total of 212 \nspecimen comprising swabs from burns (3), ulcer (15), open wound \n(165) and postoperative wounds (29) were obtained from different \nanatomical sites of hospitalized patients. Samples were collected \nonly from patients clinically diagnosed with wound infection. Clinical \ndiagnosis was based on the presence of purulent discharge or signs \nof inflammation (erythema, pain, tenderness, warmth or induration). \nThe specimen was collected using sterile Calcium alginate cotton \nswabs avoiding contamination with skin flora. Only one sample was \ncollected from each patient. Samples were transported to the \nlaboratory in Aimes transport medium following standard methods \n[10].  \n  \nIsolation and Identification of bacterial pathogens  \n  \nSpecimens were inoculated onto Blood agar, MacConkey agar, \nNutrient agar and Mannitol Salt agar and plates incubated \naerobically at 37oC for 24 to 48 hours. Pure cultures were \npresumptively identified based on their morphology, colonial and \nGram staining characteristics [11]. Their identity was confirmed by \nthe oxidase, catalase, coagulase, motility, growth on Kliger iron agar \nand the Analytical Profile Index (API) 20E assay (Biomerieux SA, \nMarcy E 'Etiole, France).  \n  \nAntibiotic susceptibility testing  \n  \nThe disc diffusion (Kirby Bauer) technique which conforms to the \nrecommended standard of the Clinical Laboratory Standards \nInstitute [12] was employed as previously described. Briefly, a small \ninoculum of each pure bacterial isolate was emulsified in 3mL sterile \nnormal saline in Bijou bottles.

S. aureus and P. aeruginosa \nwere isolated from all sample sources (Table 3). Enterobacter \naerogenes, Hafnia alvei, Serratia sakazakii and Streptococcus sp. \nwere isolated exclusively from open wounds. Majority of isolates \nwere obtained from open wounds (76.9%, 130/169). The only \nisolates from burns were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. All samples \nhad monobacterial infection.

    "text": "body 's defense mechanism. It is also possible that some organisms \ncould have been anaerobic and as such were missed as cultures \nwere incubated aerobically. This condition could therefore not \nsupport the growth of such organisms. We analyzed some \ncontributing factors to wound infection such as wound type, age, \ngender and co-morbidity (diabetes and HIV infection). Identification \nof risk factors will facilitate infection control and reduce morbidity \nfrom these infections. The rate of infection with respect to wound \ntype was as follows: burn wounds > ulcers > post operative wounds \n> open wounds (Table 1). Our results corroborate the findings of \nEkrami & Kalantar [14] who reported burn wound infection as the \nmost common infection in hospitals. The susceptibility of burn \nwound to opportunistic infections has been associated with several \nfactors including the presence of coagulated proteins, the absence \nof blood-borne immune factors, and the vascularity of the burn \nwound [1]. There was no significant difference in contamination of \nvarious wound types (P≥0.05) (Table1). Burn wounds do not seem \na major concern in our study area as we sampled only three burn \npatients throughout our study. It is noteworthy that up to 79.3% of \nsurgical wounds were infected. This high rate of post-operative \ninfection could be explained by some factors that prevailed in study \nsites at the time of study. In one of the hospitals, patient shaving in \nelective cases was done about 24 hours or more prior to the \nprocedure, rather than immediately before surgery. This long latent \ntime between shaving and surgery has been identified [15] to \nincrease post-operative infection. In addition, the sterilization \nmachine in the hospital which served as the main source of study \nparticipants broke down at one point during the study. Non-\nconventional sterilization methods were used during this period. \nThis compounded the effect of lack of water in the hospital and thus \nincreased the risk of post-operative infection.  \n  \nWe observed the highest rate of infection of 84.2% in individuals \n>60years old although there was no significant difference (P≥0.05) \nwith age (Table 1). Our findings agree with the results of Kaye et \nal. [16] who identified increasing age in adults as a risk factor for \nsurgical site infection. We attribute our findings to immunologic \nsenescence associated with increased age. Foot ulcers were the \nmain wound type in the age > 60 (Fig. 1). On the contrary, the high \noccurrence in the age groups 0-15 (84.0%) could be due to poor \nhygiene.  \n  \nMore females (82%) had infected wounds than males (78%) \nalthough the difference was not significant (P > 0.05) (Table 1). \nOn the contrary, Sorensen et al. [3] have implicated male gender as \na risk factor for wound and tissue complication and associated their \nfinding to a lesser collagen production and reduced wound healing \ncapacity in men. We investigated more males (123) than females \n(89). Differences in sample size could have resulted in a lower \nprevalence in females. Underlying diseases noted in some of our \nstudy participants were HIV infection and diabetes. Specimens from \n12 of the 14 HIV infected patients (85.7%) were infected with \ndifferent bacterial pathogens. This underscores the effect of HIV \ninfection in weakening the immune system of patients making them \nsusceptible to infection. All specimens from diabetic patients were \ninfected as well. (Table 1). Recent reports [17] reveal diabetic \nwounds to be significantly more susceptible to infection compared \nto none diabetic wounds. Cellular changes associated with diabetes \nincluding impaired leukocyte function, inadequate migration of \nneutrophils and macrophages to the wound due to compromised \ntissue perfusion predispose diabetic individuals to increased risk of \nwound infection. All diabetic patients sampled (6/6, 100%) had foot \nulcers. Studies in some parts of Cameroon [18] have reported a \nhigh mortality rate in diabetic patients due to foot ulcer infection. \nFoot ulceration and infection are among the most common and \nserious complications of diabetes mellitus with an associated high \nmortality rate and the leading risk factors for amputation [19].

    "text": "prevention of infection, prompt diagnosis and treatment are \nparamount in the prevention of morbidity, especially amputation.  \n  \nAlthough Gram-negative aerobic and facultative bacilli constituted \nthe majority of our isolates, S. aureus (28.4%) was the leading \ncause of wound infection in our study area. This was followed by \nPseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%) while S. sakazakii (0.6%) was \nthe least (Table 2). Studies elsewhere [1, 5, 20] have reported \nthese organisms as the most prevalent in infected wounds. Other \nstudies have isolated anaerobic bacteria [19] and fungi [1] in \naddition to aerobic bacteria from wounds. The high prevalence of \ninfected wounds together with the diversity of bacteria causing \nthese infections gives credence to the value of regular surveillance \nfor nosocomial pathogens in our study area. Analyzing the \ndistribution of isolates in the various wound types, it was interesting \nto note that S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the only isolates \nrecovered from all wound types and only pathogens isolated from \nburns (Table 2). We have previously isolated multi-drug resistant \nstrains of these pathogens form various clinical and environmental \nspecimens in the same study area [7, 9] indicating that they could \npose clinical challenges in health care settings in our study area. S. \naureus and P. aeruginosa have been recognized for their ability to \nproduce potentially destructive virulence factors. Open wounds \nconstituted the main source of pathogens as isolates were present \nwith high frequencies compared to other wound types. We are of \nthe opinion that this could be due to the fact that the bacterial flora \nof open wounds is seldom static, usually changing with the \nappearance of new organisms and disappearance of old ones. \nEnterobacter aerogenes, Hafnia alvei, Streptococcus. sp. and S. \nsakazakii were isolated solely from open wounds. All wounds had \nmonobacterial infection. Previous studies in neighbouring Nigeria \n[21] have reported a high prevalence of monomicrobial than \npolymicrobial infections in wounds yet others have reported a high \nprevalence of infections with polymicrobial aetiology [22] with some \nof these involving both aerobic and anaerobic organisms [23]. \nMicrobial synergy may increase the net pathogenic effect and hence \nthe severity of infections. Anaerobic bacteria and fungi could have \nbeen present in our samples but were missed out as we did not \nanalyze for them. This constituted a limitation to this study and \ncould explain our detection of infections solely with monomicrobial \naetiology.  \n  \nOfloxacin and pefloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents \nas all isolates were susceptible. Our findings agree with recent \nreports from the study area [7, 9] identifying these agents as the \nmost active and therefore the best drugs for treatment or for \nprophylaxis. Their high cost restricts indiscriminate use hence their \nhigh potency against pathogens. Other active drugs were \nceftriaxone (94.3%), gentamicin (92.7%) ceftazidime (89.7%), \nnorfloxacin (76.7%) and augmentin (76.4%) (Additional file 1). \nThus to preserve the efficacy of the fluoroquinolones for future use, \nwe recommend the use of these agents. We did not determine the \nminimum inhibitory concentrations of potent antibiotics. This \nconstituted another limitation to our study. The most inactive drugs \nwere oxacillin (0%), chloramphenicol (6.5%), erythromycin (7.1%), \nco-trimoxazole (22.6%) and aztreonam (27.4%). Previous studies in \nstudy area have reported P. aeruginosa [7] and S. aureus [9] \nresistance to some of these agents. Our data suggest that these \ndrugs are of very limited value in the prophylaxis or empiric \ntreatment of wound infections. Thus, a regular update of antibiotic \nsusceptibility through continuous surveillance is essential to \nmaintain good infection control programmes, thereby improving the \noverall infection-related morbidity and mortality.  \n  \nAnalysis of antibiotic resistance patterns of isolates gave eight \npatterns of resistance among isolates (Table 3) with a high \npreponderance of multi-drug resistant bacteria in the study area. \n"

Of utmost concern is the fact that our most predominant \nisolates, S. aureus (CAZR SXTR DXTR CR ER AMPR), K. pneumoniae \n(SXTR DXTR CR AMPR ATMR) and P. aeruginosa (SXTR DXTR CR \nAMPR ATMR), exhibited resistance to six and five drugs respectively \n(Table 3). Hence treatment of wound infection in our study area \ncould be a challenge. Resistance of these pathogens to antibiotics \nhas been high even in developed countries as such were among the \npathogens listed by IDSA [24] as urgently requiring new and \neffective therapies as they cause severe morbidity and mortality. \nThe high rate of multi-drug resistant isolates is probably due to the \nwidespread empiric use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics in study \narea for the treatment of other bacterial infections. These drugs are \nrelatively cheap and are sold by unauthorized persons and without \nprescriptions. Their high level of misuse accounts for the high levels \nresistance observed. The risk that wound patients carrying antibiotic \nresistant organisms pose to others is unknown. However, dressing \nchanges alone have been shown to disperse significant number of \nbacteria to the air [25]. Since wound patients have high contact \nwith health care staff, they may thus serve as potential reservoirs \nfor cross contamination [9]. In study area, due to lack of qualified \npersonnel, majority of staff in surgical department are nursing \nassistants, some of whom are volunteers. Because these individuals \nare not competent they provide poor quality care. This, in addition \nto their non-complicance to aseptic practices, increasing the risk of \nwound infection. Thus, recruitment of qualified nursing staff as well \nas an effective infection control policy is urgently required is \nhospitals in study sites. These will reduce or eliminate pathogenic \nand/or antibiotic resistant organisms and prevent the establishment \nof these drug-resistant organisms as the predominant flora in the \nhospital setting.  \n  \n  \nConclusion \n \nOn the basis of our findings, wound infection by multidrug resistant \nbacteria is a great concern in healthcare settings in the study area \nand reiterates the need for a strong collaboration between medical \npractitioners and microbiologists to improve treatment outcomes; \nregular update of infection control strategies; the use of \nantimicrobial agents or drug combinations with wider spectra of \nactivity for prophylaxis or treatment of wound infection, constant \nsupply of potable water to ensure high standards of hygiene and \nreduce infection. The use of natural products or non-antimicrobial \nmethods for treatment is highly recommended as resistance to \nthese is non-existent or negligible.  \n  \n  \nCompeting interests \n \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.  \n  \n  \nAuthors’ contributions \n \nAkoachere Jane-Francis Tatah Kihla: Conception and study design, \nmanuscript preparation, data acquisition; Palle John Ngunde: \nConception and Study design, manuscript preparation, data \nacquisition; Mbianda Soupsop Evelyn: Data acquisition, statistical \nanalysis; Njom HA: Data acquisition, statistical analysis; Esemu SN: \nData acquisition, statistical analysis; Roland Ndip Ndip: Study \ndesign, approval of final version of manuscript.
