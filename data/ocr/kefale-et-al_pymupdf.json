    "text": "Objective: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired \ninfection among hospitalized patients. It causes significant health problems and results in an \nextended length of hospital stay, increased cost, and increased patient morbidity and mor­\ntality. To prevent the development of SSI, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) administra­\ntion before surgery is an evidence-based practice. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the \nprevalence of SSIs and surgical antibiotic prophylaxis practice, and identifying the gap in \npracticing prophylactic surgical antibiotic use.\nMethods: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted on randomly selected \n281 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Appropriateness of surgical antibiotic \nprophylaxis was assessed by clinical pharmacists based on the standard treatment guideline. \nDescriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed in SPSS version 25. \nStatistical significance was set at p <0.05.\nResults: The overall prevalence of SSI was 19.6% (95% CI: 19–20.2). Majority of surgical \npatients (88.6%) got surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole (45.4%), and \nceftriaxone (33.3%) were the most frequently used prophylactic antibiotics. Presence of comor­\nbidity (AOR=9.18, 95% CI: 5.17–17.9, p<0.001), contaminated (AOR=6.01, 95% CI: 1.77– \n16.8, p=0.019) and dirty (AOR=7.20, 95% CI: 1.23–12.1, p=0.029) wound classes, devoid of \nprophylactic antibiotics (AOR=6.63, 95% CI: 0.89–19.3, p=0.006), the timing of prophylactic \nantibiotic administration between 1 hour and 2 hours before incision (AOR=8.2, 95% CI: 4.34– \n18.1, p=0.001), and 48 hours duration of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (AOR=7.20, 95% \nCI: 1.23–28.17, p=0.027) were significantly associated with the development of SSIs.\nConclusion: The prevalence of SSI was relatively high despite most surgical patients were \ngiven prophylactic antibiotics. The presence of comorbidity, contaminated and dirty wound \nclasses, devoid of prophylactic antibiotics, administering prophylactic antibiotics between \n1 hour and 2 hours before incision, and 48 hours duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis \nwere significantly associated with SSIs.\nKeywords: surgical site infection, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, Finote Selam General \nHospital, Ethiopia\n"

Besides, despite \nmore than three-fourth of surgical patients got surgical anti­\nbiotic prophylaxis, one in five of these patients developed SSI. \nSuperficial infections were common SSIs. In addition, more \nthan half of the prescribed prophylactic antibiotics were given \nafter the recommended time limit (30 minutes before the inci­\nsion). Further, the presence of comorbidity, contaminated and \ndirty wound class, devoid of prophylactic antibiotics, admin­\nistering prophylactic antibiotics between 1 hour and 2 hours \nbefore incision, and 48 hours duration of surgical antibiotic \nprophylaxis were significantly associated with SSIs. \nTherefore, healthcare professionals should consider the above \nrisk factors while they are undergoing surgical procedures. \nThey should also adhere to the recommended treatment guide­\nline to prescribe appropriate prophylactic surgical antibiotics.\n"
