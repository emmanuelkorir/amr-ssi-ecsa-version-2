    "text": "Abstract\nBackground  Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a variety of nosocomial infections \nin humans. This study aimed to molecularly characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing and \ncarbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species isolated from surgical site infections (SSI).\nMethods  A multicentre cross-sectional study was performed among SSI patients at four hospitals located in \nNorthern, Southern, Southwest, and Central parts of Ethiopia. The isolates were identified by microbiological methods \nand matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic \nsusceptibility was determined using disk diffusion. The presence of phenotypic ESBL and carbapenemase production \nwas detected by employing standard microbiological tests, including combined disk diffusion (CDT). ESBL and \ncarbapenem resistance determinants genes were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing.\nResults  A total of 8.7% Acinetobacter species were identified from 493 culture-positive isolates out of 752 SSI wounds. \nThe species identified by MALDI-TOF MS were 88.4% A. baumannii, 4.7% Acinetobacter pittii, 4.7% Acinetobacter soli, \nand 2.3% Acinetobacter lactucae. Of all isolates 93% were positive for ESBL enzymes according to the CDT. Using whole \ngenome sequencing 62.8% of the A. baumannii harbored one or more beta-lactamase genes, and 46.5% harbored \none or more carbapenemase producing genes. The distribution of beta-lactamases among Acinetobacter species \nby hospitals was 53.8%, 64.3%, 75%, and 75% at JUSH, TASH, DTCSH, and HUCSH respectively. Among ESBL genes, \nblaCTX−M alleles were detected in 21.4% of isolates; of these 83.3% were blaCTX−M−15. The predominant carbapenemase \ngene of blaOXA type was detected in 24 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii followed by blaNDM alleles carried in 12 A. \nbaumannii with blaNDM−1 as the most common.\nConclusions  The frequency of Acinetobacter species that produce metallobetalactamases (MBLs) and ESBLs that were \nfound in this study is extremely scary and calls for strict infection prevention and control procedures in health facilities \nhelps to set effective antibiotics stewardship.\n"

The development of third-generation \ncephalosporins was a major development in the fight \nagainst multidrug resistant microorganisms.

The main resistance determinants, \nextended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), can make a \ndiverse range of β-lactam antibiotics ineffective, includ­\ning penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams [11]. \nEnterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and A. \nbaumannii acquire and disseminate ESBL-encoding \ngenes horizontally, mainly through plasmids [12].
