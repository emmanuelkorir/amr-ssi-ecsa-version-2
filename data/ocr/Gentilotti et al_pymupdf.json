    "text": "Background\nHealth-care associated infections (HAIs) and antimicro-\nbial resistance (AMR) are major global health challenges\nrecognized worldwide The spread of HAIs and AMR is\nparticularly alarming in low and middle income coun-\ntries (LMICs) [1, 2] where high level of resistance to\ncommonly prescribed antibiotics together with lack of\nlocal AMR surveillance systems need urgent attention\n[3, 4]. According to the World Health Organization\n(WHO), HAIs are increasing at alarming high rates in\nLMICs, being two- to 20-times higher than in high-\nincome countries [5].\nSurgical Site infection (SSI) is the most frequent cause of\nHAIs in LMICs, affecting up to one third of patients under-\ngoing surgery [6]. In light of this, WHO guidelines for SSI\nprevention outlined a roadmap for quality improvement\nand suggested a multimodal strategy and multidisciplinary\napproach [7–9]. A cultural and attitude change is essential\nto ensure that protocols for Infection Prevention and Con-\ntrol (IPC) and Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) are strictly\nfollowed [10]. Although SSIs are largely avoidable, in\nLMICs they continue to be a leading cause of morbidity\nand mortality also among women undergoing caesarean\nsection (CS), a live-saving procedure classified as a clean-\ncontaminated operative wound according to Centre for\nDiseases Control (CDC) Classification [11].\nDodoma Regional Referral Hospital (DRRH) is one of\nthe few centres of the Dodoma Region, Tanzania, offer-\ning CS services. A prospective observational study con-\nducted\nin\n2013\nat\nthe\nObstetrics\n&\nGynaecology\nDepartment (OGD) of DRRH reported an extremely\nhigh prevalence of CS-SSIs (48.2%), 40.6% of them\ncaused by Staphylococcus aureus. Seventy-nine percent\nof the Staphylococcus aureus detected were methicillin-\nresistant (MRSA) [12]. A recent before-after intervention\ncohort study, conducted in five hospitals of sub-Saharan\nAfrica, found that a multimodal SSI prevention strategy\nin low-resource settings can reduce the risk of SSIs [13].\n"

In\nparticular,\nthe\nimportance\nof\nthe\nprophylaxis\nwas\nstressed. In fact, before the intervention, almost every\nwoman received an antibiotic course lasting 8–10 days\npost-CS, irrespective of the presence of risk factors or\nsigns/symptoms of infection. The antibiotic course usu-\nally included 3 days of intravenous ceftriaxone plus\nmetronidazole, followed by oral penicillin (amoxicillin\nalone or ampicillin/cloxacillin) plus metronidazole for at\nleast 5 days. The timing was highly variable, ranging\nfrom 1 to 24 h post-CS. A pre-operative prophylaxis with\nampicillin 1 g given 30–60 min before the incision was\nsuggested, based on drugs availability. The third step\nconsisted in the introduction of the prevention measures\ninto clinical practice and in the organization of seminars\nfocusing on IPC and AMS. Literature-based education\nwas encouraged. On-job trainings were also conducted\nunder the supervision of a pool of ID specialists and\nclinical microbiologists.

The follow-up was available for 1040 women, 467\n(70%) and 573 (81%) in the two studies, respectively\n(Fig. 2). A total number of 337 (25%) women (197 and 140\nin the two studies, respectively) were lost to follow up.\nThe demographic characteristics were similar in the two\npopulations. In the POST-Int a higher proportion of\nwomen had a college/university education (adj. p = 0.027),\nbut SSIs prevalence was not affected by the level of\neducation.\nTable 1 presents the CS characteristics and the surgi-\ncal procedures in all enrolled patients with available\nfollow-up and in the two study populations, separately\n(Table 1).\nIn the POST-Int study, a greater CS number was per-\nformed by experienced surgeons (adj. p = 0.052) and pre-\nincision antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in more\ncases (adj. p < 0.001). The timing of prophylaxis was re-\nported to be adequate only in 28% of cases in the POST-\nInt group, but this did not seem to affect SSI prevalence.\nOn the other hand, post-operative antibiotic administra-\ntion was significantly lower in the POST-Int group (adj.\n"

    "text": "Impact of IPC and AMS intervention on CS SSI incidence\nThis multimodal approach led to a percentage reduction\nin the CS SSIs rates by more than 65%. Furthermore,\nless SSIs were detected at first visit (8 days after the CS)\nin the POST-Int group, possibly suggesting that fewer\ninfections were acquired in the theatre room and during\ninpatient stay [17]. Strengthening the chain supply for\nantibiotics and skin disinfectant was a priority. In the\nPOST-Int study almost every CS was preceded by an\nantibiotic prophylaxis, and the skin disinfection was per-\nformed following a standardized procedure in the vast\nmajority of cases. The AMS intervention led to a better\nappropriateness\nof\nantibiotic\nprescription,\nas\ndocu-\nmented also by other studies in LMICs [18]. Post-CS\nantimicrobial prescription was limited to cases requiring\na treatment. Administering multiple doses of post-\noperative antibiotics was not associated with a better\noutcome\ncompared\nwith\npre-operative\nsingle\ndose\nprophylaxis, as also reported by other authors [19, 20].\nFurthermore, by administering a pre-operative prophy-\nlaxis instead of a 3 days intravenous post-operative\ncourse, we estimate that hospital total cost savings have\nbeen around €1500 during the Post-Int study. Moreover,\na reduction of post-discharge antibiotics prescription by\napproximately 70% was achieved. This led to a personal\nsaving of around €3/patient in a country where 28% of\nthe population is estimated to live under the national\nbasic needs poverty line (approximately €14/month per\nadult) [21]. These findings suggest that AMS pro-\ngrammes are highly recommended in LMICs to improve\nthe prescription attitude and reduce the burden of\nhealth-care associated costs.\nThe study was not designed to assess the impact of\neach prevention measure on the occurrence of SSIs. A\nstudy with a more robust design, such as an interrupted\ntime series analysis or a controlled randomized clinical\ntrial would be useful to better address this issue [22, 23].\n"

    "text": "Changes in the characteristics of the isolates after the\nintervention\nA greater proportion of microbiologically-confirmed\nSSIs in the POST-Int study was reported, possibly re-\nlated to a better collection and processing of the sam-\nples. Also the laboratory diagnostic capability seemed to\nbe improved, as suggested by the detection of Entero-\ncoccus spp, which was not identified in the PRE-Int\nstudy. In 2016 the DRRH Laboratory has been audited\nper the WHO AFRO Stepwise Laboratory Quality Im-\nprovement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA)\nChecklist and has met the requirement for “three star”\nrecognition level.\nThe significant reduction of gram-positive strains iso-\nlated and the lower MRSA prevalence in the second sur-\nvey are noteworthy. This is likely a consequence of the\nAMS education and on-job training which dramatically\naffected the health care workers’ attitude and behaviour\ntowards antibiotic prescription and IPC [31]. By avoiding\nunnecessary use of ceftriaxone in the post-operative\nperiod, the intervention may have contributed to the re-\nduction in MRSA rates in the second survey. The choice\nof Ampicillin for prophylaxis depended on the unavail-\nability of cefazolin, that is more widely used for surgical\nprophylaxis and more effective against Staphylococcus\naureus [32]. Probably, this is the reason why we observed\na similar rate in MSSA before and after the intervention.\nOn the other hand, considering the unavailability of sec-\nond line antibiotics in the majority of health facilities in\nTanzania, the high rate of MDROs - including gram-\nnegative bacteria – detected in this study is a serious con-\ncern. The lack of detailed data on MDROs prevalence all\nover the country highlights the need for building an effi-\ncient surveillance system in order to guide continuous tar-\ngeted interventions.\n"
