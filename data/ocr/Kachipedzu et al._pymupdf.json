Therefore, this study aimed to determine the inci-\ndence of SSIs, risk factors and common microorganisms associated with SSI and assess the practice of antimicrobial \nuse in women following Caesarean Section (CS) at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH).\nMethods  This was a hospital-based quantitative prospective study design involving pregnant women who under-\nwent a CS between February, 2023 and July, 2023 at QECH with 30 day-follow-ups. Wound specimens (wound swabs) \nwere collected from all infected CS wounds and processed at QECH main laboratory, and susceptibility testing \nwas conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method with results reported only as susceptible, intermediate, \nor resistant and the collected data was analyzed using Stata.\nResults  The overall cumulative incidence of SSI recorded at QECH during the study period was 9.61% (20 \ncases out of 208). Of these, 19 (95%) of them reported superficial SSI following CS. The mean age was 26.1 years \nwith a standard deviation of 6.2. All pregnant women who underwent for CS received antibiotic prophylaxis. This \nstudy revealed that 138 (66.35%) patients received both preoperative antibiotics (ceftriaxone) and post-CS antibiot-\nics without knowing the specific bacterial organism isolated. This study revealed that ruptured membrane had twice \nthe incidence of SSIs compared to intact membrane (χ2 = 2.0922), though not statistically significant. The majority \nof patients with SSIs (n = 12, 60%) were readmitted and 5 (25%) out of 20 with SSIs had antimicrobial resistance follow-\ning susceptibility testing. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism (3, 60%) and other bacterial isolates \nincluded were Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumanni.\n"

    "text": "Background\nCaesarean section (CS) is a lifesaving operative technique \nin which a foetus, placenta, and membranes are delivered \nthrough an abdominal and uterine incision. Surgical site \ninfection (SSI) is defined as an infection that occurs at or \nnear the surgical incision within 30 days of the operation \nor after 1 year if an implant is placed [1–3]. Globally, SSI \nis the second most reported health-care associated infec-\ntion (HAI), accounting for 19.6% of HAIs [4]. Numerous \nstudies have reported incidence rates of post-CS SSIs, \nfor example, 2.85% in India [5], 21% in Ethiopia [6] and \n7–9.6% in Nigeria [5, 7]. HAIs and antimicrobial resist-\nance (AMR) are major global health challenges recog-\nnized worldwide. However, the spread of HAIs and AMR \nis particularly alarming in low- and middle-income coun-\ntries [8]. SSI accounts for 20% of all HAIs and is associ-\nated with a 2–11  fold increase in the risk of mortality, \nwith 75% of SSI-associated deaths directly attributable to \nSSI [9, 10].\nThere are limited data on surgical site infections (SSIs) \nin African countries such as Malawi [11]. A prospective \nsurvey conducted by Borgstein at QECH in Blantyre \nshowed an overall infection rate of 25.8% and that for \nclean wounds of 14.8% [12]. In many SSIs, the responsi-\nble pathogens originate from the patient’s endogenous \nflora [13]. The causative pathogens depend on the type \nof surgery; the most commonly isolated organisms are \nStaphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, \nEnterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli. Other studies have \nshown that Staphylococcus aureus is a commonly isolated \norganism in SSIs, accounting for 20–30% of SSIs occur-\nring in hospitals [5, 13, 14]. A survey revealed that cae-\nsarean section procedures carry a risk of infection 5–20 \ntimes that of normal delivery [6].\nDifferent studies have shown that the rational use of \nantimicrobials in women of childbearing age is impor-\ntant because it affects this population as well as their off-\nspring. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics may result \nin the appearance of drug-resistant organisms [15]. The \nuse of antimicrobial prophylaxis for caesarean section \nhas been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative \nmorbidity, cost and duration of hospitalization. Another \nstudy reported the incidence of infection even after \nantimicrobial prophylaxis due to pre-existing infection, \ndebilitating disease or prolonged rupture of membranes \n[15].\nIn addition, another study reported that once antibi-\notics are intensively misused, they are undoubtedly the \nmain factor associated with the high numbers of antibi-\notic-resistant pathogenic and commensal bacteria world-\nwide [16, 17]. Similarly, a study by Classen et al. revealed \nthat a delay in surgery reduces patient protection and can \nlead to the occurrence of postoperative infections [18]. \n"

Additionally, Kaye et al. reported that age was a \npowerful predictor of SSI [35]. However, other studies \nhave also reported contamination or dirt operation as a \nrisk factor [25] and wound classification as clean contam-\nination for the CS procedure [19].\nThe present study revealed that all the women who \nunderwent CS were given antibiotic prophylaxis with \nceftriaxone. The average duration from the first dose \nof antibiotic prophylaxis to the start of the CS proce-\ndure was 12.85  min, with a standard deviation of 8.44 \n(IQR = 8). The prevalence of SSI and the timing of anti-\nbiotic prophylaxis in clinical practice have not been \nthoroughly investigated, but some clinical trials have \nindicated a relationship [18]. In the same study by Clas-\nsen et al. [18], few patients developed SSI among those \nwho received antibiotic prophylaxis early before the start \nof surgery compared to those who received antibiotics \nlater after surgery. Furthermore, in the present study, \nthree patients who received post-CS antibiotic prophy-\nlaxis and two patients who did not receive antibiotics \nafter surgery had antimicrobial resistance. Of course, \nthese patients without any confirmed infection diagnosis \nreceived antimicrobial treatment after caesarean section; \nhence, this therapy cannot be applied as an indicator of \nSSI. The inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents need-\nlessly exposes patients to potential toxicity and risks \nthat promote the development and spread of antimicro-\nbial resistance, leading to increased medical care costs \nin healthcare facilities [25]. However, the rational use of \nantimicrobials in women of child-bearing age is impor-\ntant because it affects this population as well as their off-\nspring. [15].\n"

Most patients were \ncontinued on antibiotics post CS procedure without \nperforming culture to ascertain AMR. The inappro-\npriate use of antibiotics may result in antimicrobial \nresistance. Therefore, due to the increased number of \nSSIs following CS and the relative emergence of antimi-\ncrobial resistance to some microorganisms, including \nAcinetobacter baumanni and Staphylococcus aureus, \nintensive infection control practices are needed and \nestablish AMS programs and routine surveillance of \nSSIs at QECH. In addition, there is a need to conduct \nfurther studies on bacterial isolates and antimicro-\nbial resistance patterns and how to best address AMR \nthrough one health approach.\n"
