    "text": "Background: Although emergency health-care services, particularly clinical and surgical care, are an important part of the provision\nof high quality health care in Ethiopia, infections related with surgical care are still the most well-known medical services-related\ndiseases. This study aimed to assess the bacterial profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates among patients diagnosed\nwith surgical site infections at Mizan-Tepi university teaching hospital, southwest Ethiopia.\nMethodology: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from June to September 2021. Patient data were collected\nusing a structured questionnaire. Follow-up of patients who had undergone a surgical procedure was conducted for at least 30 days.\nWound swabs were collected from patients suspected to have surgical site infections (SSIs) and cultured onto appropriate culture\nmedia. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the disk diffusion technique. Data were analyzed using SPSS software\nversion 25.0. Frequencies and cross-tabulation were used to summarize descriptive statistics.\nResults: In this study, the postoperative SSIs rate was 12.6%. All patients with SSIs were culture positive, and a total of 41 bacterial\nisolates were detected. Of these, 73.2% were Gram-negative, 26.8% were Gram-positive and 24.2% were a mixture of two bacterial\ngrowths. Escherichia coli accounted for 29.3%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.5%), Proteus species (14.6%) and\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%). With the exceptions of amikacin and meropenem, which exhibited very high sensitivity, ranging\nfrom 33.3–100.0% isolates was resistant against all other tested antibiotics. The resistance rate to three or more classes of antibiotics\nwas 100.0%.\nConclusion: In this study, the most isolated bacteria causing SSIs were Gram-negative and multidrug-resistant strains. This event\nhighlights that surveillance of the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern coupled with the implementation of the strict\nprotocol for antibiotic use and operative room regulations is important to minimize the burden of SSIs.\nKeywords: surgical site infections, bacterial profile, antimicrobial resistance, Ethiopia\n"

The SSIs are the most recognized nosocomial infections, accounting for 15% of all\nnosocomial infections. The risk is that most SSIs are caused by bacteria which are resistant to commonly used\nantimicrobial agents, and can be multidrug-resistant pathogens.1–3\n"

Moreover, it is useful to collect\ndata on the risk factors in order to analyze SSI outcomes by subgroup, identify high-risk patients, and control for\ndifferences in the patient-level risk. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the bacterial profile and antimicrobial\nsusceptibility pattern of isolates among patients diagnosed with SSIs at Mizan-Tepi university teaching hospital, south-\nwest Ethiopia.\n"

The surrounding areas of the surgical wound were cleaned with 70% ethyl alcohol and excess debris\nfrom the wound base was removed by irrigating with normal saline to avoid contaminating the swab with skin flora.\nThen, two swab samples were collected from at least 1 cm2 area of viable wound tissue using a sterile cotton swab from\nthe infected site, one for Gram stain and another for culture. The deepest parts of the wounds were sampled, to avoid\nsuperficial micro-flora. All the collected samples were kept in test tubes containing 1.0 mL of normal saline and taken to\nthe microbiology laboratory of Mizan-Tepi university for analysis within 3 hours after collection. An aseptic technique\nwas applied to avoid cross-contamination at all stages.\n"

Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were differentiated from other\nGram-negative bacilli by performing two rapid catalase and oxidase tests. Biochemical tests such as citrate utilization\ntest, Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar test, Sulphite-Indole–Motility (SIM) test, and urease tests were used to differentiate\nenteric bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus were identified from CoNS with their colony characteristics on the mannitol salt\nagar plate and by performing coagulase tests. All the isolates were kept at 2–8°C in nutrient broth until antimicrobial\nsensitivity tests were done.\n"

In addition, ranging from 50.0% to 83.3%, Gram-negative isolates were\nresistant to ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Gram-\npositive isolates of S. aureus showed higher resistance towards ampicillin (87.5%) followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic\nacid, doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, clindamycin, and erythromycin, all with resistance rate of 75.0%. S. aureus also\nshowed resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol, each with a resistance rate of 62.5%. Using a cefoxitin disk as\na surrogate marker, 3/8 (37.5%) of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Two out of three (66.7%)\nisolates of CoNS showed resistance to the above antibiotics, except cefoxitin, in which one out of three (33.3%) CoNS\nshowed resistance.

The rate of SSIs in this study was 12.6% and among\ncesarean sections, it was 9.3% (14/150). The current finding is slightly higher than those found in studies from different\nparts of the developing world, including in Ethiopia.23–27 In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the combined\nincidence of SSIs is 11.8%.6,28 However, this finding is lower than the study finding in other parts of Ethiopia, in which\nthe average rates of SSIs was 21.5%.16,29–32 Compared with developed countries, this finding is higher than those of\nseveral European countries and the USA, in which the cumulative incidence of SSIs ranges from 0.8–9.5% in Europe33\n"

Many factors in the patient’s journey through surgery have been identified as contributing to the risk of\nSSIs. Accordingly, a significantly higher rate of SSIs was observed in the age group of >50 years, presence of co-morbid\nconditions such as anemia and diabetic mellitus, post-operative hospital stay greater than 14 days, ASA class ≥III,\ncontaminated wound procedure, and providing ampicillin as antibiotic prophylaxis (p <0.05).\nThe present findings seem to be consistent with other research findings which highlighted some SSI risk factors, such\nas age, ASA class, wound classification, skill and experience of the surgeon, duration of surgery, blood transfusion, and\nemergency surgery.16,19,26,29,31 Therefore, the prevention of these infections is complex and requires a comprehensive set\nof preventive measures before, during, and after surgery.\nThe other objective of the present study was to evaluate bacterial profiles causing SSIs and their antimicrobial resistance\npatterns. Accordingly, 73.2% Gram-negative and 26.8% Gram-positive SSIs-causing bacteria were detected. Of the Gram-\n"

In addition, 50.0–83.3% of isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin,\ndoxycycline, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) towards more commonly used three or\nmore classes of antibiotics was 100.0%. High resistance rates toward the above antibiotics were also reported in other\nstudies.26,29,30,38,39 A study in Tanzania also showed that the majority (97%) of the Gram-negative bacteria were resistant\nto more than four classes of antibiotics.40 This can pose a huge challenge for the prevention of SSIs, especially in our\ncase where ampicillin and ceftriaxone are the most commonly used antibiotics in all patients undergoing surgery.\nAmong Gram-positive bacteria, 87.5% of Staphylococcus aureus showed resistance to ampicillin, and 75.0% were\nresistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, clindamycin, and erythromycin. In addition, 37.7–\n62.5% of S. aureus was resistant to cefoxitin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol. The presence of highly resistant bacteria\ncausing SSIs has also been reported in other studies.26,29,30,38–40 This significantly higher resistance may be related to the\nfrequent and inappropriate use of these antibiotics for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes in human infections. The\nstudies have demonstrated almost linear relationships between antibiotic consumption and the prevalence of antimicro-\nbial resistance (AMR).42,43 For instance, in Ethiopia, many studies confirmed that ceftriaxone is the most prescribed\nantibiotic prophylaxis.44,45 The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the selective pressure of bacteria and\nstimulates the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens.\n"

All patients with SSIs were culture positive for at least one\nbacterial species. Multidrug-resistance was seen in almost all of the isolates leaving clinicians with few choices of drugs\nfor the treatment of patients with SSIs. Moreover, an increased prevalence of SSIs was observed in older patients, the\npresence of co-morbid conditions such as anemia and diabetes mellitus, postoperative hospital stay, types provided for\nantibiotic prophylaxis, and types of wound and ASA class. Therefore, periodic surveillance of the bacterial profile and\nantibiotic susceptibility testing coupled with the implementation of a strict protocol for antibiotic administration and\noperative room regulations is important to minimize the burden of SSIs with resistant bacteria pathogens.\n"
