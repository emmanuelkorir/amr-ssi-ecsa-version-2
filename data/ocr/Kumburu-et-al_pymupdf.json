    "text": "Abstract\nobjective To determine the causative agents of infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility at a\ntertiary care hospital in Moshi, Tanzania, to guide optimal treatment.\nmethods A total of 590 specimens (stool (56), sputum (122), blood (126) and wound swabs (286))\nwere collected from 575 patients admitted in the medical and surgical departments. The bacterial\nspecies were determined by conventional methods, and disc diffusion was used to determine the\nantimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial isolates.\nresults A total of 249 (42.2%) specimens were culture-positive yielding a total of 377 isolates. A\nwide range of bacteria was isolated, the most predominant being Gram-negative bacteria: Proteus\nspp. (n = 48, 12.7%), Escherichia coli (n = 44, 11.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 40, 10.6%) and\nKlebsiella spp (n = 38, 10.1%). Wound infections were characterised by multiple isolates (n = 293,\n77.7%), with the most frequent being Proteus spp. (n = 44, 15%), Pseudomonas (n = 37, 12.6%),\nStaphylococcus (n = 29, 9.9%) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 28, 9.6%). All Staphylococcus aureus tested\nwere resistant to penicillin (n = 22, 100%) and susceptible to vancomycin. Signiﬁcant resistance to\ncephalosporins such as cefazolin (n = 62, 72.9%), ceftriaxone (n = 44, 51.8%) and ceftazidime\n(n = 40, 37.4%) was observed in Gram-negative bacteria, as well as resistance to cefoxitin (n = 6,\n27.3%) in S. aureus.\nconclusion The study has revealed a wide range of causative agents, with an alarming rate of\nresistance to the commonly used antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the bacterial spectrum differs\nfrom those often observed in high-income countries. This highlights the imperative of regular\ngeneration of data on aetiological agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns especially in\ninfectious disease endemic settings. The key steps would be to ensure the diagnostic capacity at a\nsufﬁcient number of sites and implement structures to routinely exchange, compare, analyse and\nreport data. Sentinel sites (hospitals) across the country (and region) should report on a representative\nsubset of bacterial species and their susceptibility to drugs at least annually. A central organising\nbody should collate the data and report to relevant national and international stakeholders.\n"

    "text": "well as other chronic conditions such as cancer and kid-\nney disease.\nIn Africa, infectious diseases constitute a much higher\nburden in people of all age groups [8–13] than in Europe\nand North America. Active surveillance systems on infec-\ntious disease control are inadequate in most African\ncountries [14–17], and the absence of data on disease\ncauses and the lack of control measures add to the dis-\nease burden [6]. Obtaining adequate and timely data on\ninfectious diseases in African countries is difﬁcult,\nwhereas much more data are available from developed\ncountries. As a result, empirical treatment in Africa\nregarding pathogenic bacteria might be based on data\nfrom clinical laboratories in developed countries [18].\nThe pattern of bacterial infections in Africa differs from\nthose observed in Western Europe and North America;\nhence, empirical treatment should be adjusted to ﬁt the\ndifferent need. In Africa, as elsewhere, regular local data\ncollection about patterns of infections, and their response\nto antimicrobial agents, coupled with a long-term com-\nmitment to providing adequate health information sys-\ntems, is key to effective planning and policy formulation.\nThe availability of data on disease patterns, etiological\nagents and their antimicrobial resistance is a prerequisite\nfor the establishment of empirical treatment regimens and\nfor avoiding escalation of the global trend of bacterial\nresistance to the current antimicrobial regimens [19–21].\nThis study was conducted to determine the most fre-\nquent bacterial species isolated from samples submitted\nfor microbiological examinations at a tertiary care hospi-\ntal in Moshi, Tanzania. We also determined antimicrobial\nsusceptibility patterns of the isolates and associated\ncomorbid conditions.\n"

Other\nbacterial spp such as Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter\nbaumannii, Serratia spp, Morganella morganii and Provi-\ndentia spp were resistant by 100% to ampicillin. Resis-\ntance of Proteus spp, Klebsiella spp and E. coli to\ncefazolin was (n = 23, 82.1%), (n = 16, 61.5%) and\n(n = 11, 57.9%), respectively, with all other spp at 100%\nresistance. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins\n(ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) was as well observed for\nKlebsiella spp (n = 14, 53.8% and n = 12, 46.2%) and\nE. coli (n = 8, 42.1% and n = 7, 36.8%), Table 5a.\nAmong the Gram-positive isolates, S. aureus was the only\nspecies, which demonstrated detectable resistance to peni-\ncillin (n = 22, 100%), erythromycin (n = 11, 50%),\ntrimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (n = 10, 45.5%), as well\nas cefoxitin (n = 6, 27.3%). All S. aureus in this study\nwere sensitive to vancomycin (refer to Table 5b). Table 5c\nsummarises the susceptibility pattern of the six cefoxitin-\nresistant S. aureus and 16 cefoxitin-susceptible S. aureus.\nResistance of cefoxitin-resistant S. aureus to other drugs\n"

Both Gram-negative and positive species\nwere observed. Our ﬁndings are in agreement with other\nstudies in Africa where wound infections tend to manifest\nwith a variety of bacterial pathogens [23, 24]. This is\nexplained by the complexity of wound specimens that\nwill tend to have a variety of bacterial pathogens,\ndepending on the way wounds were acquired. Wounds\nacquired from a community environment will have more\ndiverse organisms than hospital-acquired wounds [25,\n"

In our study, there were few positive blood speci-\nmens (n = 15, 6%) on culture, a ﬁnding which is in\nagreement with other studies that showed a low positive\ngrowth of blood cultures [27]. Possibly this is because\nmost septicemia cases we tested were not due to bacterial\ninfections, a ﬁnding that has been reported from other\nstudies in Tanzania [28]. The use of antibiotic prior to\ncoming to the hospital, which hinders the detection of\nsusceptible organisms [29], may be another reason. This\nis a practice which is very common in Tanzania and\nother developing countries [30–32]. KCMC being a ter-\ntiary care hospital receives patients referred from health\nfacilities in Kilimanjaro region and other parts of Tanza-\nnia. The majority of these patients have been treated with\nantibiotics in the referring hospital. However, the patients\ncould also have self-medicated as antibiotics are easily\navailable and policies to control improper use of antibi-\notics are non-existent in Tanzania, as in other developing\ncountries [30, 32–35].\n"

It is likely these patients received antibi-\notics during their previous treatment. The most fre-\nquently used drugs were ceftriaxone (46.2%),\nmetronidazole (39.4%), cloxacillin (17.1%), ciproﬂoxa-\ncin (6.6%) and co-trimoxazole (5.5%).

The ﬁnding is in agreement with\nother two studies in Tanzania which indicated resistance\nof E. coli and Klebsiella to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa-\nzole, ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and gentam-\nicin (100%, 96%, 88%, 60%) and (85%, 95%, 70%,\n70%), respectively [46, 47]. Resistance ranging from\n9.1% to 78% also has been noted to ciproﬂoxacin and\nnalidixic acid. These are categorised as second-line drugs\nin Tanzania, yet they show a high frequency of resis-\ntance. As ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin,\nwe expected its use to be controlled, yet it was the most\nused. Moreover, convincing percentages of resistant\nstrains of E. coli and Klebsiella to ﬁrst and third-genera-\ntions of cephalosporins have been broadly noted, ranging\nfrom 36.8% to 61.5%. This ﬁnding suggests existence of\nextended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) bacteria, as has\nbeen addressed in other studies in Tanzania [23] where\n64.3% of E. coli and 80% of Klebsiella pneumoniae\nwere ESBL producers. The presence of ESBL producers\nreduces treatment options, resulting in higher morbidity\nand mortality due to severe infections and sepsis.\nStaphylococcus aureus was the predominant spp among\nGram-positive isolates. It accounted for 6 (27.3%) of the\nobserved resistances to cefoxitin and other antibiotics\nsuch as erythromycin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole\nand penicillin G, a characteristic that we would postulate\nto indicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA)\nclones, as has been suggested in other studies [48].\n"

    "text": "The study has revealed a wide range of causative agents,\nwith an alarming rate of resistance to the commonly used\nantimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the bacterial spectrum\ndiffers from those observed in high-income countries. This\nhighlights the imperative of regular generation of data on\naetiological agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility\npatterns especially in infectious disease endemic settings.\nThe key steps would be to ensure the diagnostic capacity at\na sufﬁcient number of sites and routine exchange, compar-\nison, analysis and reporting of data. As the minimum, sen-\ntinel sites (hospitals) across the country and region should\nreport on a representative subset of bacterial species and\ntheir susceptibility to drugs at least once a year. A central\norganising body should collate the data and report to all\nrelevant national and international stakeholders [49].\n"
