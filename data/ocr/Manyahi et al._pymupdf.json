Pus\nswabs or pus were cultured on blood agar (Oxoid, UK) and MacConkey agar (Oxoid, UK) and incubated aerobically\nat 37°C for 18–24 hours. Bacterial identification was done using API 20E and VITEK and antimicrobial susceptibility\nwas determined by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion.\nResults: Of the 100 patients, from whom wound swabs were collected, 90 (90%) had positive aerobic bacterial\ngrowth. A total of 147 pathogenic bacteria were isolated, including 114 (77.5%) gram negative and 33(22.5%) gram\npositive organisms. The most prevalent bacterial species were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), followed by\nStaphylococcus aureus (12.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.8%). Of the 18 S. aureus , 8 (44%) were methicillin\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and three of them (17%) were carrying both MRSA and induced clindamycin\nresistance (ICR). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae were observed in 23\n(79.3%) of the 29 isolates tested. Majority of Escherichia coli 12 (92.3%) and K. pneumoniae 11 (69%) isolates were\nESBL producers. About 63% (93/147) were multiple-drug resistance (MDR) isolates, and the overall MDR among\nGram positive and Gram negative bacteria was 60.6% (20/33) and 61.4%, (73/114), respectively. The prevalence of\nMDR for E. coli, A. baumannii and P. stuartii was 100% each. Majority (97%) of the Gram negative bacteria were\nresistant to more than four categories (classes) of antibiotics.\n"

    "text": "Background\nSurgical site infections (SSI) remain a common and wide-\nspread problem that contributes to significant morbidity\nand mortality, prolongs hospital stay and consequently in-\ncreasing health care cost [1]. Globally, SSI is reported to\nbe the third most common nosocomial infection preceded\nonly by urinary tract infections and pneumonias [1,2]. The\noutcome of SSI is partly attributed to increase in anti-\nmicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens [3], which make\nthe choice of empirical therapy more difficult. Globally,\nthe incidence of SSIs may range from 1.5 – 20% de-\npending on the diversity and complexity of procedures\nperformed, age of patients, pre-operative hospitalization,\nlength of surgery as well as geographical locations [4,5].\nSSI remains the major cause of nosocomial infections\nin Tanzania that imposes substantial burdens on health-\ncare resources [6]. Recent studies reported increase of\nSSI ranging from 19.4% to 36.5% [7-10], being higher at\nMuhimbili National Hospital (MNH) compared to other\nreferral hospitals [10]. In these studies Staphylococcus aur-\neus was reported to be a predominant pathogen followed\nby Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species with varying\nantimicrobial susceptibility patterns. A study at Bugando\nMedical Centre (BMC) reported resistance to ciprofloxa-\ncin of 86%, 80% and 54% for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae\nand S. aureus respectively. Of the E. coli and K. pneumo-\nniae involved in SSI at Bugando Medical Centre 65% and\n80% were ESBL producers, respectively [7]. Rural settings\nhave not been spared of the antibacterial drug resistance\nproblem as shown by a study done (2004) at a remote dis-\ntrict hospital in Tanzania which reported more than 95%\nof S. aureus isolates being resistant to penicillin with 1\n(0.8%) being resistant to methicillin [8]. However, recent\ndata from the same geographical location has revealed sig-\nnificant increase of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA)\n(18.8%) causing SSI [7].\nPrevious studies conducted in Tanzania have shown\npersistently high levels of antimicrobial resistance in\nbacteria isolated from urine and bloodstream infections\n[11,12]. However, there is rather limited data regarding\nthe magnitude and pattern of antimicrobial resistance\namong pathogens causing SSI. We undertook this study at\nMNH, which is the national referral hospital, and where\nantimicrobial use is probably the highest to determine\nantimicrobial resistance pattern, including multidrug re-\nsistance, among bacteria causing SSI.\n"

    "text": "level of resistance to ciprofloxacin was 20 – 56% in En-\nterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii, showing\nan increase in resistance compared to (6.7 – 30%) previ-\nously reported at this hospital in 2004/2010, [11,19]. Re-\nsistance to ciprofloxacin is an early warning sign since\nfluoroquinolones are effective agents for treatment of\ngram negative bacterial infections [21].\nWith regard to third generation cephalosporins we found\nvery high levels of resistance (67 -100%) among Gram\nnegative bacteria, with most of E coli and K. pneumoniae\nbeing ESBL producing strains. These finding is in keeping\nwith recent studies from Northern-Western Tanzania and\nUganda that shows (61 – 92%) [7,22]. We noted that about\n80% of patients received ceftriaxone as prophylaxis, thus\nfavoring the emergence of resistant bacteria.\nSignificantly, we note an increasing trend of resistance\nto cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxa-\ncin over a period from 2004 to 2012 (Figures 3 and 4)\n[11,19]. In addition to the high rate of resistance to indi-\nvidual antibiotics, we also found significant number of\nMDR isolates. The overall proportion of MDR among\nGram negative bacteria isolates was high (64%), this find-\ning is in agreement with recent study from Uganda [22].\nWe noted that, all Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter bauman-\nnii and Providentia stuartii were MDR strains.\nThe very high levels of antibiotics resistance seen in this\nstudy could be attributed, at least in part, to inappropriate\nuse of antimicrobial agents affects both the cost and effi-\ncacy, thus favoring the emergence of resistant bacteria.\nOne of the limitations of our study is cross-sectional\ndesign of the study. Also there was no patient follow up\nafter discharge up to 30 days which is required accord-\ning to CDC definition of SSI and hence some cases of\nSSI after discharge from hospital may be missed.\n"

There is a very urgent\nneed of revising the perioperative antimicrobial prophy-\nlaxis at this national referral Hospital to provide clinicians\nwith standardized approach to the rational, safe and effect-\nive use of antibiotics management of SSI.\n"
