    "text": "The global spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an increasing challenge for clini-\ncians in Uganda, where microbiological diagnostics are not routinely available or accessible.\nThe aim of this study was to determine pathogen prevalence and antibiotic resistance pat-\nterns in patients with wound infections following trauma at a national referral hospital in\nKampala, Uganda. In addition, the suitability of currently used empirical treatment options in\nthis setting was evaluated. This prospective, observational study analysed antimicrobial pre-\nscriptions, culture results and antimicrobial sensitivity testing (AST) of wound swabs and\nblood samples from patients with clinical signs of wound infections on the trauma ward. A\ntotal of 124 patients (n = 99, 79.8% male) with a median age of 30 years (IQR 23–39) were\nenrolled between October 2021 and January 2022. Wound infections were classified as\nnosocomial in 69% of the cases. Pathogens were isolated from 122 wound swabs, yielding\n238 bacterial isolates. The most prevalent pathogens were gram-negative bacteria including\nEscherichia coli (n = 48, 20.2%) and Acinetobacter spp. (n = 43, 18.1%). Empiric treatment\nconsisted of ceftriaxone and gentamicin which was administered to 67.2% (n = 78) and\n62.1% (n = 72) of patients, respectively. High rates of antimicrobial resistance could be dem-\nonstrated across gram-negative and gram-positive species towards the most common\nempiric antibiotics. Following the AST results, over 95% (n = 111) of patients required a\nchange of treatment. Our findings demonstrate that current empiric treatment for wound\ninfections is missing its target in hospitalized patients in Kampala. To address the growing\nproblem of AMR in Uganda, there is a pressing need to enhance diagnostic capacity and\nimplement structured antimicrobial stewardship programs.\n"

While Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest mortality and disease burden [2], even basic\nmicrobiological diagnostics are still inaccessible in many health care facilities [3,4]. A review of\nAMR in the Eastern African Region showed elevated resistance rates especially towards the\nmost commonly used antibiotics, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and ceftriaxone [5]. Due to limited\ncapacity for microbiologic diagnostics and thus a lack of local surveillance data in resource-\nlimited settings, the choice of antibiotics is mostly empirical, and rarely based on bacterial sus-\nceptibility [5,6]. In the absence of diagnostic services a general use of non-targeted, broad-\nspectrum antimicrobials is encouraged [7], driving resistance in itself.\n"

    "text": "Despite being the first African country to implement a structured national AMR surveillance\nprogram in alignment with the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System\n(GLASS) in 2015 [8], the magnitude of AMR in Uganda remains largely unknown due to a\nlack of access to microbiological diagnostics. A National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR was pub-\nlished in 2018 [9] and set strategic objectives on surveillance, diagnostics and access to antimi-\ncrobials [10]. However, so far no national lab-based surveillance system for routine care has\nbeen established [3]. Data collection is incomplete, and comprehensive antimicrobial steward-\nship (AMS) is not routinely performed at Ugandan hospitals [11]. Expertise and capacity in\nthe existing laboratories is often skewed towards HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and most recently\nCOVID-19, leaving other areas of microbiology less developed [12].\nEven though Uganda offers free basic health care, patients are mostly required to pay out-\nof-pocket for microbiological diagnostics, which many cannot afford. The retrospective data\navailable from sentinel surveillance sites show a high rate of resistance to commonly used anti-\nbiotics for gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens alike [8,13]. In a recent study focusing\non surgical patients in Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH) an increasing trend in\nAMR was reported over a five year period [14].\nOne explanation for the increase of resistance could be the overuse of ceftriaxone, especially\nas peri-operative prophylaxis and through prolonged post-operative administration [15,16]. A\nrecent study from Kampala also showed that up to one out of every two patients admitted to\nmedical wards received a prescription of ceftriaxone [15]. Further gaps can be found in the lack\nof locally adapted empirical prescribing guidelines for antimicrobials and the low compliance of\nclinicians with the national clinical guidelines [16,17]. Documentation on drug administration\nis often not sufficient, leading to frequent missed doses of antimicrobial treatment even in hos-\npital settings [18]. In addition, self-medication poses a problem, as many patients purchase anti-\nmicrobials directly over-the-counter (OTC) in community pharmacies or drug shops [19,20].\nThe lack of regulation on OTC antimicrobial purchases leads to a surveillance gap, increases the\nrisk of mis- and overuse of antimicrobials, and subsequently the spread of AMR.\n"

    "text": "HIV seroprevalence of 5.7% in our sample is in accordance with the Ugandan average (2020\nprevalence estimates: 5.4% among adults aged 15–49 years [37]).\nHealthcare-associated infections, especially surgical-site infections are more common in\nlow resource settings [38]. In our study, more than two-thirds of wound infections were classi-\nfied as nosocomial, which is also reflected by the pathogens identified. Most swabs yielded\ngram-negative pathogens, predominantly E. coli and Acinetobacter spp.. These results corre-\nsponds to data of trauma wards in other low resource settings, which show similar pathogen\ndistributions in wound infections [26–28,39]. Of the five most common pathogens in our sam-\nple, three were intrinsically resistant to the most commonly used empiric treatment ceftriax-\none (Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp.), and the remaining species\ndisplayed resistance to ceftriaxone in over 90% (E. coli 95.7%, Klebsiella spp. 93.8%).\nThese high rates of resistances against commonly used empiric antibiotics are consistent\nwith results of the few available studies from Uganda that focused on surgical patients, includ-\ning patients with chronic wounds [40], patients with surgical site infections (SSI) [41], and a\nretrospective analysis of various diagnostic materials from MNRH over a period of five years\n[14]. A study on patients with SSI across several surgical wards of MNRH in 2011 showed\nlower rates of resistance, e.g. 78% resistance for E. coli towards ceftriaxone Carbapenem resis-\ntance of Acinetobacter spp in Uganda tertiary hospitals was previously estimated to lie between\n4–24% depending on the study [42,43]. However, our analysis showed a resistance rate of 38%,\nwhich is a relevant increase. While the available data may be insufficient to determine a trend,\nit does support the need for accurate annual surveillance data from routine diagnostics to\nmonitor the spread of AMR in the country and identify risk factors. Nosocomial infections\nmight be more common in Uganda as hospital stays tend to be long due to treatment delays\nand IPC is often not optimal [44]. Despite the young age and low rate of comorbidities, a quar-\nter of our study participants had used antimicrobials in the past year. Over 80% of them\nbought antimicrobials directly in community drug shops or pharmacies without a medical pre-\nscription, which underlines the high prevalence of self-prescription in our sample, similar to\nthe available literature [19,20].\nIn our study, AST results led to a treatment switch for nearly all patients. Prior to our\nresearch intervention, empirical antibiotic treatment on the ward was commonly based on\nclinical judgement without knowledge of pathogen and resistance patterns. The ability to per-\nform microbial testing was limited, since it is an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense for most\npatients in this setting. However, the data presented here suggests that empiric treatment with\nceftriaxone and gentamicin misses the target when it comes to wound infections following\ntrauma and can therefore not be recommend. The use of AST in our study enabled the diversi-\nfication of treatment options and guided clinical decision-making. While some patients were\nin need of expensive, often hardly accessible carbapenems, in many cases cheap alternatives\nexisted. In general, our results highlight that a setting with a high rate of nosocomial infections\nin trauma patients calls for antibiotics which have a high efficacy in the gram-negative spec-\ntrum, secure a high degree of tissue penetration and are easily accessible. However, our results\nalso show that there was no “one-fits-all” empiric therapy for in-patients with wound infec-\ntions. Instead, our results underline the need for targeted therapy based on AST. To address\nthe insufficient treatment of patients and the spread of AMR on Uganda trauma wards, routine\ndiagnostic as well as clinical treatment guidelines, which consider local resistance patterns,\nneed to be established.\nCommonly under-recognized, accessibility of diagnostics is fundamental to quality health\ncare and should be incorporated in universal health coverage [7,45]. Both, microbial cultures\nand AST are part of the WHO list of essential in vitro diagnostics [46]. Timely results from\nAST need to be available to health care workers, and should form the foundation for AMS-\n"

    "text": "Compared to previous studies using routine or retrospective data from surgical wards, this\nstudy’s prospective design serves as an important advantage [14]. It included all patients with\nclinical signs of wound infections, whereas the routine data is skewed towards patients who\nare able to pay for diagnostics. Due to the set-up of study procedures embedded the ward,\nthere was no loss to follow-up. Thus, this study delivers an accurate picture of the distribution\nof pathogens and their resistance profiles in wound infections on the trauma ward. As\ndescribed above, the study populations composition regarding sex, age and HIV-prevalence,\nsuggests a sufficient representability for trauma patients in Ugandan tertiary care centres. The\nstudy was set in the clinical care setting and used the same pathways as routine care, the results\ntherefore mirror the real-life situation on the ward.\nHowever, our study also has some limitations, which are partly due to the monocentric\ndesign with a limited number of participants (n = 124). Baseline data, including prior treat-\nments and in-hospital stays, was collected through patient interviews. This potentially led to\nrecall bias, especially concerning events in the past. However, there are no alternative data col-\nlection systems for this information. Because of incomplete documentation of referrals and\nself-treatment with over-the-counter antibiotics, the timing and dose of previous treatments\nand the duration of previous hospitalizations were not available for assessment. In this respect,\na mixed picture of predominantly nosocomial, possibly (still ambulatory-acquired) and fuzzy\n\"in-between\" situations must be accepted. Since this was an observational study, it is not possi-\nble to compare clinical outcomes of our study participants for instance to a matched popula-\ntion. Furthermore, the majority of patients received antimicrobial treatment before the study\nsamples could be collected, which may have contributed to the low number of positive blood\ncultures and a pre-selected bacterial spectrum of the wound swabs.\nAs wounds following trauma are a non-sterile environment, and contaminants or skin-col-\nonizing isolates might be sampled, results from wound swabs should be interpreted with cau-\ntion [50,51]. Due to the study setting on the ward, it was not possible to obtain deeper cultures\n(e.g. intraoperative sampling) to guide therapy in this context. Instead, superficial cultures\nwere obtained which may not represent the infectious pathogens. In order to optimize sample\ncollection, the study teams were trained in appropriate sampling according to the Levine\nmethod [29,30]. These swabs still may identify bacteria superficially colonizing the wounds. As\nno swabs identified Group A Streptococcus and few identified Staphylococcus aureus, we would\nnot assume that these bacteria represent the infectious causes. As most samples were taken\nafter antibiotics, we would expect to see higher rates of resistance among colonizing bacteria as\nwell. However, this does give a snapshot which bacteria are identified in and around patients,\npointing to increasing resistance. In particular, Acinetobacter spp. infections show high levels\nof resistance. To add more information on pathogens in wound infections, intraoperative sam-\nples and samples taken before the start of antibiotic therapy should be analysed in future\nstudies.\n"
