The study sought to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of \nbacterial isolates from postoperative wound infections among patients attending Mama Lucy Kibaki \nHospital. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out between October 2018 and March 2019. It \nincluded patients of all age groups with surgical site infections following general, obstetrics, and \ngynecological surgeries. Pus swabs were obtained aseptically from 58 consented patients with clinical \nevidence of surgical site infections. Gram stain, culture, biochemical tests, and antibiotic susceptibility \ntests were done for each pus swab. The preponderant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (28.2%) \nfollowed by Escherichia coli (15.4%). Whereas Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 65.4% (n=17) \nof the total Staphylococcus species. Chloramphenicol was the most sensitive drug to all the bacteria \nisolates. Ampicillin and amoxycillin recorded resistance rates >90% against gram-positive and gram-\nnegative bacteria. The majority of the gram-negative rods were highly resistant. Hence, this calls for \ncontinuous monitoring of the susceptibility patterns to determine the profile of surgical site infections \nbacteria isolates found in the hospitals. \n \nKey words: Surgical site infection, antibiotic susceptibility, bacteria prevalence, Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nSurgical site infections (SSI) are a worldwide problem in \nsurgery accounting for increased deaths, morbidity, and \nelevated healthcare costs in surgical patients (Badia et \nal., 2017; Gelhorn et al., 2018).

The other swabs from each patient were \ninoculated on MacConkey agar and blood agar and the inoculated \nplates incubated at 35 to 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, the plates \nwere examined for growth. Colony characteristics such as \nswarming growth and hemolysis on blood agar, changes in physical \nappearance in differential media, and enzymatic activities of the \norganisms were used for preliminary bacterial identification. \nBiochemical tests such as catalase, coagulase, urease, indole, \nmethyl red, Voges Proskauer and citrate (IMViC) tests were \nperformed for the identification of the various bacteria. \n \n \nAntibiotic susceptibility testing \n \nAntibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on Mueller Hinton \nagar using various antibiotics by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method \nas per standards prescribed in bacteriology (Hudzicki, 2016). Using \na sterile swab, Mueller Hinton agar surface was uniformly coated \nwith the suspension of the test organism matching 0.5 McFarland \nturbidity standard. Following incubation of test plates and controls at \n35°C for 24 h, the plates were examined for confluent growth. \nEscherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC \n25923 were used as control strains. The zones of inhibitions were \ndetermined using breakpoints provided by the Clinical and \nLaboratory Standards Institute and British society for antimicrobial \nchemotherapy (CLSI, 2016; BSAC, 2013). The following antibiotics \nwere tested for resistance; Chloramphenicol (50 ug), Vancomycin \n(30 ug), Amoxycillin (30 ug), Doxycycline (30 ug), Ciprofloxacin (30 \nug), Cefepime (30 ug), Ceftriaxone (30 ug), Amikacin (30 ug), \nGentamicin (30 ug), Oxacillin (1 ug), Cotrimoxazole (25 ug), \nAzithromycin (15 ug) and Ampicillin (10 ug). These antibiotics were \nselected based on the availability and prescription frequency of \nthese drugs in the study area. \n \n \nData analysis \n \nData were entered in excel, cleaned, and the information exported \nto   IBM  statistical   package   for  the  social  sciences  version  20.\n"
