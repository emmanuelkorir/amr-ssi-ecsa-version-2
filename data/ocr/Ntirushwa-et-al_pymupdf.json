The 2015 WHO recommendations \nfor the prevention and treatment of maternal puerperium infections \nrecommend a single dose of first-generation cephalosporin or \npenicillin for prevention of post cesarean infections but with weak \nevidence.5 Considering the timing of giving prophylactic antibiotics, \nIt was previously feared that administrating antibio-prophylaxis \nbefore skin incision could affect the baby in utero, however, according \nto several studies, there is strong evidence that prophylactic antibiotic \nfor cesarean delivery given before skin incision rather than after cord \nclamping decreases the incidence of postpartum endometritis and \ntotal infectious morbidities without affecting neonatal outcomes.6 \nAnother important aspect of prophylactic antibiotic for cesarean \nsection is related to the type of antibiotics to use, the choice has to \nbe made based on the type of common organisms likely to cause \n"

The antibiotics must be present not only in the \nplasma but also in the tissues during the surgical procedure, and in \nmost cases, very short prophylaxis, usually using a single bolus is \nconvenient.7 In 2004 E. Ahmed et al. found no difference between \na single dose of ceftriaxone versus Ampicillin/Cloxacillin given at \nthe induction of anesthesia.8 A Cochrane systematic review done by \nDahlke JD et al ,recommended that a single dose of ampicillin or first-\ngeneration cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, should be administered \nin all women undergoing cesarean delivery and given 15 to 60 minutes \nbefore skin incision.9 According to various research findings, evidence \nsupports the use of pre-skin incision broad-spectrum antibiotics10 and \nthere is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference \nbetween the use single dose versus multiple-dose regimens . In 1988 \na multicenter comparative study done by Galask RP et al in the USA \ncompared a single dose of cefotetan versus multiple-dose cefoxitin as \nprophylaxis in patients undergoing cesarean section and no difference \nin cases of endometritis or surgical site infection was seen.11 Despite \nall the evidence about the use of a single dose of antibiotics, resistance \nto change is common in many hospitals; for example, in a teaching \nhospital, southern Taiwan, dissemination of evidence was done and \nclinicians were informed about single-dose prescription as evidence-\nbased best practice and follow-up evaluations were made to see how \nthe information has helped clinicians change their practices. The rate \nof single-dose prescription only increased from 14.2% to 22.4% and \nthe study concluded that knowledge of evidence does not improve \npractice uniformly; more other interventions were encouraged to \nimprove practice.12\n"

    "text": "While the overall incidence of SSI was 4.00%, the rate of SSI at \ndischarge, which was day 3 in our study, was only 25 % of all cases of \nSSI while the majority of new cases were seen on day 7 with a total of \n8 cases corresponding to 66.6% of all cases of SSI. Only one case was \ndiscovered on day 15 and no new cases of SSI were discovered on day \n30 of follow-up. This finding show that most of the cases of SSI post-\ncesarean section develop when women are already discharged and a \nsurveillance system or education about the signs and symptoms of \nSSI should be systematically done at the time of discharging women. \nThe low rate of SSI at discharge was similarly found in a study done \nby Opøien HK et al , by which a tatal rate of SSI was 8,9 % during an \nobservation of 30 days post cesarean sections compared to only 1,8% \nobserved at the time of discharge.24\n"

Despite the observed difference in numbers of cases, the P \nvalue was 0.204 though not statistically significant. Based on the low \noccurrence of SSI in our population with an overall SSI rate of 4 %, \na sample size of approximately 500 women would be necessary to \ndetermine the difference in both groups with a bigger strength. With \nthe few numbers of cases of surgical site infections found in our \nstudy; both interventions are equivalent in outcome as the difference \nin the number of cases observed in both groups still remain in the \nequivalence margins and does not show any statistically significant \ndifference to conclude otherwise.\n"
