    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to determine the proportion and mechanism of resistance to ceftriaxone and \nceftazidime among Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli and examine the burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \nfrom caesarean section surgical site infections in Uganda.\nMethods: Wound swabs from 109 caesarean section surgical site infections were cultured for pathogenic bacteria following \nstandard microbiological procedures. The Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion technique was used for antimicrobial susceptibility \ntesting. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus diagnosis was based on polymerase chain reaction testing for the mecA gene. Data were \nanalysed using SPSS-IBM Statistics v.20.\nResults: A total of 118 pathogens were recovered from 93 (85%) of 109 surgical site infections swabs. Of the 118 pathogens, \ngram-negative bacteria were 69 (58.5%), including 44 (37.3%) Klebsiella species, 11 (9.3%) E. coli, 6 (5.1%) Citrobacter species, \nand 8 (6.8%) other gram-negative bacteria. In total, 49 of the 118 pathogens were gram-positive bacteria, including 34 \n(28.8%) S. aureus and 15 (12.7%) Enterococci species. Resistance to ceftriaxone was detected in all 11 (100%) of the E. coli and \nin 43 (97.7%) of the 44 Klebsiella species and to ceftazidime in all 11 (100%) of the E. coli and 40 (91%) of the 44 Klebsiella \nspecies. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase explained resistance to ceftazidime in 10 (91%) of the 11 E. coli and 19 (48%) \nof the 40 Klebsiella species. Carbapenemase production explained 15 (38%) of the 40 ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella species. \nMethicillin-resistant S. aureus was detected in 91% of S. aureus.\nConclusion: Klebsiella species, E. coli, and S. aureus–majority methicillin-resistant S. aureus dominated the pathogens in \ncaesarean section surgical site infections. Almost all of the E. coli and Klebsiella species were resistant to ceftriaxone or \nceftazidime. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was the underlying resistance mechanism among almost all of the ceftriaxone- \nor ceftazidime-resistant E. coli. However, this mechanism accounted for less than half of ceftriaxone- or ceftazidime-resistant \nKlebsiella species, where carbapenemases accounted for 40% of the resistance, a finding previously unreported in Uganda.\n"

In \nsub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of SSI tends to be higher;4 \nfor instance, in Kano, Nigeria, the incidence rate was esti-\nmated to be 9.1%.4 At Mulago National Referral Hospital in \nKampala, Uganda, where around 500 C/S are performed \nmonthly, there is hardly any reported data on the incidence of \npost-C/S SSIs. However, unpublished 2016 hospital records \nrevealed that approximately 25–30 patients developed SSI \nmonthly following C/S. If the infection is caused by drug-\nresistant pathogens, treatment with readily available antimi-\ncrobials may fail to eliminate the infection, potentially \nprogressing to sepsis, a cause of maternal death in 10.7% and \n30.9% of patients globally and in Uganda, respectively.7,8\n"

    "text": "While SSI is a common problem following C/S, limited \ndata exist on the causative bacterial species and their suscep-\ntibility to antimicrobials at Mulago Hospital Uganda. This \nmakes it difficult to accurately treat patients there, and in \nsimilar settings, where routine culture and antimicrobial sus-\nceptibility testing (AST) remain scarce. Studies conducted \nelsewhere have reported various findings regarding the bac-\nterial aetiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the \ninvolved pathogens. A retrospective chart review of 191 \npatients in the United States in 2010 found methicillin-resist-\nant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the most common \norganism isolated in post-C/S infections.9 Studies in Asia \nfound the most common organisms in post-C/S SSIs to be \nEscherichia coli, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \nwith high levels of MRSA and extended-spectrum beta-lac-\ntamase (ESBL) occurrence.10,11 A retrospective case–control \nstudy in Nigeria from 2001 to 2002 which examined post-\nC/S SSI found gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and S. aureus \nto be the most common pathogens, with 100% of GNB \nreported to be sensitive to cephalosporins.4 Recent studies in \nTanzania and Rwanda found the most predominant patho-\ngens in post-C/S SSIs to be S. aureus and Klebsiella spe-\ncies.12,13 Unlike in Tanzania, no MRSA was reported in the \nRwanda study. However, these were prospective cohort stud-\nies conducted not only on post-C/S mothers who were symp-\ntomatic for SSIs but also on all post-C/S women. The only \npublished study on bacterial aetiology of SSI at Mulago \nNational Referral Hospital in Uganda was conducted almost \n10 years ago, and it involved all SSIs, irrespective of the type \nof surgery. That study found Escherichia coli and S. aureus \nas the most common pathogens in 24% and 21% of SSIs, \nrespectively;14 75% of the E. coli were ESBLs, and 38% of \nS. aureus were MRSA. While that study examined SSI, it did \nnot focus on post-C/S SSIs specifically, which forms the \nbasis of this study.\n"

We, \ntherefore, adjusted the sample size based on the sample size \ncalculation formula for finite (known) populations,17 that is, \nn1 = N/(1 + {(N − 1)/Pop}] where, n1 is the required sample \nsize, N is the estimated sample size from the first formula, \nthat is, 304, and Pop is the finite population that we would \nhave access to during the study period, that is, 125 mothers \nwith clinical features of post-C/S SSI during the study \nperiod.

ESBL \nproduction as the mechanism of underlying resistance to cef-\ntriaxone or ceftazidime in E. coli and Klebsiella species was \nscreened based on the disc diffusion test when zone diame-\nters of ceftazidime (30 μg) alone were compared with cef-\ntazidime/clavulanate \n(30/10 μg) \nzone \ndiameters \non \nMueller–Hinton agar.21 An enhanced inhibition zone diame-\nter of at least 5 mm around the ceftazidime/clavulanate \n(30/10 μg) disc relative to ceftazidime alone indicated posi-\ntive ESBL production in that particular bacterial pathogen as \nshown in Figure 1.\nIf no zone diameter increase occurred, we considered it to \nbe a non-ESBL mechanism of resistance to ceftazidime, \nwhich could be ampC or carbapenamase production, as nei-\nther of these two is inhibited by clavulanic acid. If a non-\nESBL ceftazidime-resistant organism was found to be \nsusceptible to carbapenems, ampC was considered as the \nresistance mechanism to the ceftazidime. However, if the \norganism was resistant to carbapenems, then carbapenamase \nproduction was considered as the mechanism of resistance to \nceftazidime.\nFor gram-positive organisms, susceptibility was tested \nagainst penicillin (10 units), vancomycin (30 μg), linezolid \n(30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), tetracycline \n(30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), trimetho-\nprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 μg), and chloramphenicol \n(30 μg).

Flattening of \nthe zone of inhibition adjacent to erythromycin (D-zone), \nthat is, a positive D-test, was interpreted as inducible clinda-\nmycin resistance as shown in Figure 2.\nMRSA was identified based on polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR) testing for the mecA gene as described below.\n"

Seni \net al.14 in 2012 found S. aureus in 20.4% of all SSIs, and \nanother study carried out in Ethiopia identified S. aureus as \nthe causative pathogen in 23.4% of SSIs.29 Another study in \nRwanda reported S. aureus as the dominant pathogen in \n62.5% of organisms, although this study looked at only 16 \nsamples.12 Several other studies also found S. aureus to be a \ndominant pathogen in post-C/S SSIs.3,4,12 Other studies also \nreported multiple pathogens recovered through culture of \nswabs from post-C/S SSIs. In our study, 25 (27%) of the 93 \nswabs resulted in the growth of more than one pathogen, a \nfinding only slightly lower than the 37% multiple-pathogen \nrecovery from swabs reported in a 2012 Mulago hospital \nstudy, among SSIs from all surgical wards at the hospital.14 \nFrom the above discussion, it appears that proper manage-\nment of post-C/S SSIs with antimicrobial agents requires \nprior culture and susceptibility testing and use of more than \none antimicrobial drug of reasonable efficacy, with low \nresistance rates, targeting gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, \nS. aureus and Enterococcus.\nConsidering antimicrobial resistance in relation to the lim-\nited resources allocated to patients attending Mulago and sim-\nilar hospitals in Africa, it is worrying that all GNB were found \nto be resistant to the otherwise readily available drugs, such as \nampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and to the com-\nmonly used third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone, or \n"

    "text": "ceftazidime. High percentages of resistance to ampicillin \n(90%–100%) among GNB pathogens, as detected in our study, \nhave also been reported in several studies carried out in Africa, \nincluding Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda.14,29,30 In addition, \nthe same studies reported that over 90% of these gram-nega-\ntives were also resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (aug-\nmentin), which is another readily available drug on the \nessential drug lists of hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa. \nFurthermore, the resistance to third-generation cephalospor-\nins, particularly ceftriaxone or ceftazidime, in all E. coli and in \nover 90% of Klebsiella species is one of the greatest clinical \nchallenges since these drugs are the most extensively pre-\nscribed agents for empirical treatment of SSIs in these \nresource-limited settings. A study in 2011–2012 by Seni \net al.14 found resistance to these third-generation cephalospor-\nins in 78% of E. coli and 87% of Klebsiella species. Thus, it \nappears that this resistance prevalence is increasing in Uganda.\nIn clinical settings, the mechanism of resistance to ceftri-\naxone or ceftazidime (third-generation cephalosporins) \nunderpins the subsequent choice of drug for use in the treat-\nment of patients with SSIs. Of the 11 E. coli strains that were \nresistant to ceftazidime, 10 (91%) were ESBL producers and \nthus potentially treatable with a third-generation cephalo-\nsporin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, such as cla-\nvulanate, since ESBL enzymes are conventionally inhibited \nby clavulanate, or with carbapenems, since these agents are \nnot hydrolysed by ESBL enzymes. However, this would not \nbe the case with Klebsiella species, where only 19 of the 40 \nceftazidime-resistant isolates were ESBL producers, and 15 \n(37.5%) of the other 21 showed additional resistance to car-\nbapenems. The actual mechanism of resistance to ceftazi-\ndime among these 15 isolates was, therefore, most likely due \nto the production of carbapenemases since these isolates \nshowed phenotypic resistance to carbapenems. For the \nremaining six isolates, the mechanism was most likely due to \nampC beta-lactamase production or due to some other mech-\nanisms that were not studied here.31 It appears that the bur-\nden of resistance to carbapenems is increasing among the \nKlebsiella species in Uganda. Our claim is supported by data \nreported in a study by Seni et al.14 in 2012, which did not find \nany Klebsiella species isolated from SSIs to be resistant to \ncarbapenem agents. However, in our study, conducted 6 years \nlater, we found 15 isolates to be carbapenem-resistant. \nCarbapenem antimicrobial agents have been used as a last-\nresort, salvage treatment option for infections caused by \nmultidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB). \nInfections caused by carbapenem-resistant GNB are \nextremely difficult to treat, and the overall 30-day mortality \nin the case of systemic infections has been reported up to \n50%.32,33 Whereas SSIs are largely local wound infections, \nsome do progress to systemic infections, and if the causative \nagent is a carbapenem-resistant organism, the risk of mortal-\nity can be high.\nAmong the GPB, the most worrying form of resistance is \nMRSA. MRSA occurs when S. aureus acquires a novel gene \n"

Our study revealed a \nvery high MRSA prevalence compared to findings in the pre-\nvious studies in Uganda, which found MRSA resistance in \nonly 30%–40% of S. aureus,3,14,29,30,36 again suggesting that \nthe burden of MRSA is increasing in Uganda.\nThe reasons for the worsening state of resistance remain \npoorly studied in the local settings. However, the use of the \nhitherto broad-spectrum drugs, such as ceftriaxone, for \nprophylaxis, and other instances of inappropriate use of such \nagents, has been suspected as one of the underlying causes of \nresistance. A meta-analysis study that involved 51 ran-\ndomised controlled trials reported that ampicillin and first-\ngeneration cephalosporins have similar efficacy in \nprophylactic treatment of SSI.37 According to the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in \nSurgery, cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, is the \ndrug recommended for primary prophylaxis in C/S surgeries \nsince it is more specific with a narrower antibacterial spectra, \nin addition to it being an inexpensive product.38 Furthermore, \nan observational prospective cohort study in 2018 at a ter-\ntiary hospital in Thailand reported no difference between \nampicillin and ceftriaxone in the prevention of SSIs after C/S \nand recommended the use of ampicillin for prophylactic \ntreatment in C/S patients.39 In Mulago and many hospitals in \nUganda and sub-Saharan Africa, almost all patients undergo-\ning C/S surgical procedures are given intravenous ceftriax-\none, with or without metronidazole, either pre-, intra- or \npost-operatively, a practice which is probably based on drug \navailability in hospitals. In this study, contrary to the recom-\nmendations above, all except 14 patients (for whom we \ncould not obtain information) received antimicrobial proph-\nylaxis with ceftriaxone and/or metronidazole, as shown in \nTable 1. Ceftriaxone is reported not to be appropriate for sur-\ngical prophylaxis because of its pharmacokinetic profiles \nand the fact that being a broad-spectrum drug, its overuse \ncan exert a selective pressure that quickly results in the emer-\ngence of multidrug-resistant organisms.40 It is, therefore, \npossible that the high proportion of resistance to ceftriaxone \nor ceftazidime, as reported in our study, could be due to \nselective pressure occasioned by the uncontrolled and often \ninappropriate use of these agents in Uganda’s health facili-\nties for over 10 years.\nIn addition, we found that ceftriaxone and metronidazole \nwere routinely used to treat post-C/S SSIs without prior cul-\nture and susceptibility testing data, and this has been the \nstandard practice in the study clinical settings. Due to the \nhigh resistance rates reported in our study, it is possible that \n"

Since ESBL resistance mechanisms were \nthe most prevalent causes based on our data, the use of these \nthird-generation cephalosporins, in combination with a beta-\nlactamase inhibitor such as sulbactam, could be considered.\nFurthermore, our finding of MRSA in over 90% of cases \nwhere the use of ceftriaxone and metronidazole for C/S SSI \ntreatment was employed clearly demonstrates that there is \nlittle logic to this practice since all MRSA strains are resist-\nant to all beta-lactams, including ceftriaxone. This may \nimply that the treated SSI patients who eventually recovered \ndid so due to wound care, patient immunity and possibly \nmetronidazole, which has been shown in previous in vitro \nstudies to kill MRSA,41 although susceptibility of MRSA to \nthis drug was not part of our study. Infections due to MRSA \ncan only be treated with other chemical classes of antimicro-\nbials (not beta-lactams).

    "text": "Considering all of the above, there is an urgent require-\nment for a review of the guidelines for C/S antimicrobial \nprophylaxis and first-line antibacterial treatment of post-C/S \nSSI in settings such as Mulago Hospital. Patients with SSIs \nwho routinely receive ceftriaxone and metronidazole proba-\nbly improve not because of antibacterial drug treatment, but \ndue to wound hygiene and their own immunity. From our \nstudy, ciprofloxacin (to which approximately half of \nKlebsiella species or S. aureus were susceptible), chloram-\nphenicol (to which approximately three-quarters of E. coli \nand S. aureus were susceptible), and penicillin (to which \n93% of Enterococcus were susceptible) would appear to be \nthe drug combination of choice for oral treatment of SSIs, as \nno other effective options appear to be available. However, \nciprofloxacin, a quinolone, is not recommended in breast-\nfeeding mothers due to the possible adverse effects in skele-\ntal tissues of the newborns/children less than 8 years of age. \nChloramphenicol, if given orally, is also associated with \nsevere nausea and vomiting and may also cause bone mar-\nrow suppression. This leaves clinicians with a very narrow \nchoice for oral treatment of SSIs, a fact that calls for enhanced \ncombined efforts in the control and prevention of the spread \nof antimicrobial resistance.\nFor systemic infections arising from SSIs, a third-genera-\ntion cephalosporin combined with (1) a beta-lactamase \ninhibitor, carbapenems, or amikacin to cover gram-negatives \nand (2) vancomycin for GPB appears to be the best choice of \nantibacterial treatment. However, it should be noted that \namikacin can cause both autotoxicity and renal toxicity.\n"

Almost all of the E. coli and Klebsiella species were \nresistant to ceftriaxone or ceftazidime. ESBL was the under-\nlying resistance mechanism among almost all the ceftriax-\none- or ceftazidime-resistant E. coli, but this mechanism \nrelated to less than half of ceftriaxone- or ceftazidime-resist-\nant Klebsiella species, where carbapenemase production \ncaused closer to 40% of the resistance, a worrying finding \npreviously unreported in Uganda. The clinical implication of \nour findings is that majority of post-C/S SSIs in Mulago \nNational Referral Hospital may not be treatable using ceftri-\naxone or ceftazidime alone but potentially treatable with \nthird-generation cephalosporins combined with a beta-lacta-\nmase inhibitor to block ESBLs but more than half of the \nceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella species could not be man-\naged this way since many out-rightly demonstrated carbap-\nenemase production as mechanism of resistance to the \nceftriaxone, ceftazidime and carbapenems themselves. \nAmong the S. aureus pathogens, 9 of every 10 strains were \nMRSA and thus not treatable with almost all beta-lactam \nagents, yet many were also resistant to other antimicrobial \nclasses.
