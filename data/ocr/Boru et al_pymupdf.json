An organism causing SSIs is usually derived from the host’s internal \nenvironment, surgical materials, or the theatre environment during the \noperation, leading to exogenous causes of infection. Therefore, infection \nprevention and control practices can minimise the risk of SSIs [ 12 ]. \nThe resistance patterns of bacteria vary globally. An increase in an- \ntimicrobial resistance in hospitals and communities, such as Methicillin- \nresistant S. aureus and Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus , is associated with \nthe use of antibiotics [ 13 , 14 ]. Although the development of antibiotic \nresistance presents a challenge to the eﬃcient management of bacte- \nrial infections, the introduction of antimicrobial therapy in SSI man- \nagement reduces treatment costs, prolonged hospital stays, and signiﬁ- \ncant morbidity and mortality caused by these infections [ 15 ].

They are \nresponsible for approximately 20% of readmissions [ 19 ]. SSIs lead to in- \ncreased mortality, morbidity, reoperation, prolonged hospital stays, loss \nof daily wages, and increased healthcare costs, all of which are consid- \nerably higher in cases involving antimicrobial-resistant organisms [ 20 ]. \nThe global proportion of SSIs ranges from 2.5-41.9%, with a high risk \nof HAI in patients undergoing surgery, and 77% of hospital-acquired in- \nfections are related to SSIs [ 21 ]. In the USA, the proportion of SSIs is \n2-5%, accounting for 3% of postoperative mortality [ 8 ]. In Latin Amer- \nica, Asia, and China, SSI prevalence has been reported at 7%, 4%, and \n4%, respectively [ 22 ]. \nIn developing countries, the prevalence of SSIs is higher than in the \ndeveloped world, with varied reports [ 23 ]. In African hospitals, SSIs \nare the primary infections [ 24 ], with a cumulative incidence ranging \nfrom 2.5-30.9% [ 3 , 25 ]. In Ethiopia, the incidence rate of SSIs ranges \nfrom 10.9-75% [ 26 , 27 ]. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of bac- \nteria related to SSIs vary globally, depending on local epidemiology \nreports, region, and susceptibility testing methodology. Bacterial resis- \ntance presents a signiﬁcant challenge and requires complex treatment. \nMost antimicrobial resistance data have been obtained from advanced \ncountries [ 28 ].

Sociodemographic and \nclinical data were collected using a predesigned semi-structured ques- \ntionnaire through face-to-face interviews and medical record reviews. \nThis study followed the CDC SSI surveillance methods [ 31 ]. \nThe clinical diagnosis of SSIs was performed by the attending physi- \ncian. Clinical features of the surgical site, such as pain, redness, swelling, \nwarm skin around the wound, yellow or green discharge, unpleasant \nodour, fever, and chills, were considered indicative of SSI. Participants \nwere asked to sign an informed consent form before participating in \nthe study. Wound swabs were collected aseptically using sterile cotton \nswabs, and deep wound aspirates were collected aseptically by trained \nnurses. Specimens were coded using a speciﬁc identiﬁcation number. \nThe sample was transported to the Medical Laboratory Sciences Depart- \nment microbiology skill laboratory of Bule Hora University within 2- \n4 hours using Amies transport medium, maintaining a temperature of \n37°C. \n"

The diameter of the zone of inhi- \nbition around the discs was measured and recorded to the nearest mil- \nlimetre using a ruler, and the isolates were classiﬁed as sensitive, inter- \nmediate, or resistant based on the CLSI standard table [ 38 ]. Antimicro- \nbial susceptibility tests were carried out using the following antibiotics \n(Oxoid, UK): Amoxicillin (AMC, 20/10 μg), Ceftriaxone (CRO, 30 μg), \nAmpicillin (AMP, 25 μg), Cloxacillin (COX, 5 μg), Ceftazidime (CAZ, \n30 μg), Cefoxitin (FOX, 30 μg), Gentamicin (GN, 10 μg), Clindamycin \n(DA, 2 μg), Penicillin (P, 10 μg), Tetracycline (TE, 30 μg), and Chloram- \nphenicol (CAP, 30 μg).

    "text": "In the present study, the overall prevalence of SSI was 15.8%. A to- \ntal of 41 diﬀerent bacteria were isolated. This result is consistent with \nstudies conducted in Addis Ababa (11.1%) [ 38 ], Harari (11.8%) [ 39 ], \nMizan-Tepi (12.6%) [ 40 ], Wolaita Sodo (13%) [ 30 ], Hawassa (19.1%) \n[ 41 ], western Ethiopia (19.6%) [ 42 ], and Jimma (21.1%) [ 43 ]. Simi- \nlar ﬁndings have been reported in other countries, such as Sierra Leone \n(11.5%) [ 44 ] and India (20.8%) [ 45 ]. However, the results of this study \nare lower than those of other studies conducted in Dessie (23.4%) [ 46 ], \nArba-Minch (29.4%) [ 47 ], and Egypt (67.6%) [ 48 ]. Conversely, the re- \nsults were slightly higher than those of similar studies conducted in Ad- \ndis Ababa (9.8%) [ 49 ], Gonder (9.9%) [ 50 ], the USA (7.8%) [ 51 ], and \nMexico (7.9%) [ 52 ]. This variation may be attributed to diﬀerences in \nstudy populations, study periods, and sample sizes, as well as the fact \nthat those studies involved a larger and more diverse group of partic- \nipants and beneﬁted from advanced facilities with superior infection \ncontrol practices, such as modern surgical procedures, improved venti- \nlation in operating rooms, advanced sterilisation methods, and proper \npatient care. Additionally, variations could result from inadequate pre- \noperative wound care, insuﬃcient infection control techniques due to \npoor hygiene, and a lack of water. Poor-quality equipment and infras- \ntructure, a shortage of advanced supplies and trained personnel, sub- \nstandard infection control techniques, and severe ﬁnancial constraints \nin developing countries frequently contribute to the incidence of SSIs \nand compromised patient care [ 53 ]. \nIn this study, among the 41 bacteria isolated from 29 patients with \nSSIs, approximately 21 (51.2%) were Gram-positive bacteria. This pre- \ndominance of Gram-positive organisms aligns with previous studies \nconducted in Arbaminch [ 46 ] and Yekatit 12 hospitals [ 54 ]. The pre- \ndominant organism in this study was S. aureus (14, 34.1%), followed \nby coagulase-negative staphylococci (7, 17.1%), E. coli (6, 14.6%), P. \naerogenosa (6, 14.6%), Klebsiella spp. (5, 12.2%), and Proteus spp. (3, \n7.3%). This predominance of S. aureus agrees with ﬁndings from previ- \nous studies in Addis Ababa (37%) [ 54 ], Arbaminch (76%) [ 46 ], Harari \n(30.3%) [ 39 ], Ethiopia (36%) [ 55 ], as well as studies from other coun- \ntries, including India (34%), [ 56 ], and India (45.3%) [ 48 ], and Egypt \n(27.4%) [ 47 ]. This supports the observation that most organisms iso- \nlated from SSIs are derived from the patient’s ﬂora and the theatre en- \nvironment, where S. aureus is a common isolate [ 12 ]. \nAccording to this study, E. coli was the third most predominant \nisolate, accounting for approximately 6 (14.65) of cases, following \ncoagulase-negative staphylococci . However, other studies conducted in \nAddis Ababa (23.1%) [ 49 ], Mizan-Tepi, Ethiopia (29.3%) [401], and \nMexico (27.5%) [ 52 ], reported E. coli as the most predominant isolate. \nThis variation in predominance may be attributed to diﬀerences in study \npopulations and the variety of surgical procedures performed. It is well \nestablished that the bacterial ethology of SSIs varies with geographi- \ncal location, between countries, and even between hospitals [ 50 ]. The \ndiversity of organisms isolated in this study is consistent with similar \nﬁndings from studies conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [ 54 ], Nige- \nria [ 57 ], and India [ 56 ]. Furthermore, the results of this study support \n"

    "text": "CDC reports, which indicate that S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylo- \ncocci, and E. coli are the most predominant bacteria associated with SSIs. \nThis may be because these organisms are common causative agents of \nhospital-acquired infections and are frequently isolated from inanimate \nsurfaces and medical equipment. \nAmong Gram-positive isolates, S. aureus was found to be highly re- \nsistant to P (11, 78.6%) and CAZ (11, 78.6%). The highest sensitivity \nof S. aureus was observed against CAP (13, 92.9%), followed by DA \n(12, 85.7%), ciproﬂoxacin (10, 71.4%), COX (10, 71.4%), and others, \nrespectively. This high resistance to P and CAZ is in agreement with sim- \nilar studies conducted in Harari (100%) [ 39 ], Addis Ababa (89%) [ 54 ], \nand India (100%) [ 47 ]. Unlike S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylo- \ncocci showed little variation in the degree of sensitivity , as they were \nalmost 100% sensitive to COX, AMP, and CAP, and 85.7% sensitive to \nCRO, ciproﬂoxacin, and DA. They also showed high resistance to peni- \ncillin (5, 71.4%) and ceftazidime (4, 57.1%). This result supports that \nof a previous study in India [ 47 ]. This high resistance may be due to \nself-medication practices and the frequent and inappropriate use of an- \ntimicrobial agents. \nThis study indicated that Gram-negative isolates exhibited high resis- \ntance to commonly used antibiotics. All Gram-negative isolates showed \ndiﬀerent degrees of sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents, \nincluding ciproﬂoxacin, TE, CRO, and GN, whereas most E. coli and P. \naerogenosa isolates exhibited high resistance to AMP and CAZ, followed \nby P and AMC. This result is in agreement with similar studies from \nAddis Ababa [49,54] , Arbaminch [ 46 ], Mizan-Tepi [ 40 ], and Tanzania \n[ 58 ]. This may be attributed to the fact that these antibiotics are easily \nobtained and are frequently taken without a prescription [ 6 ]. \nAmong Enterobacteriaceae, P. species showed the highest resistance \nto TE (2, 66.7%) and GN (2, 66.7%). This result agrees with those re- \nported from Mizan-Tepi [ 40 ], Arbaminch [ 46 ], and Addis Ababa [ 49 ]. \nAccording to the results of this study, the age group ( > 54 years) was \nsigniﬁcantly associated with SSIs ( P = 0.036). This result agrees with \nsimilar studies conducted in Mizan-Tepi [ 40 ], Wolaita Sodo [ 30 ], Ar- \nbaminch [ 46 ], Hawaii [ 41 ], and Harar [ 39 ]. This result shows that as \nthe age of patients increases, the risk of developing SSIs also increases. \nThis conﬁrms the ﬁndings of other authors, which reveal that as the age \nof the patients increases, the immune defence of the host decreases, the \noccurrence of chronic disease increases, and both predispose to the oc- \ncurrence of SSIs [ 41 ]. In this study, a hospital stay duration of 10 days or \nmore was found to be signiﬁcantly associated with SSI risk. These signif- \nicant associations support similar studies conducted in Mizan-Tepi [ 40 ], \nWolaita Sodo [ 30 ], Hawaii [ 41 ], Shire, Ethiopia [ 27 ], and India [ 56 ]. \nThis may be due to the fact that hospital wards are visited by a large \npopulation with poor infection prevention practices, and prolonged hos- \npital stays increase the risks of nosocomial infections, as postoperative \npatients are more susceptible to HAIs [ 8 ]. \nThis study indicate that longer durations of operations ( ≥ 2 hours) \nincrease the rate of SSIs ( P = 0.048). This result is in agreement with \nthose of previous studies conducted in Hawaii [ 41 ], Ethiopian hospitals \n[ 50 ], Dassie [ 45 ], Jimma [ 44 ], and India [ 56 ]. This increased risk may \nbe because prolonged operation times expose the surgical site to en- \nvironmental contamination. In addition, prolonged surgical procedures \nincrease the extent of tissue damage, the possibility of blood loss, and \nstress due to prolonged anaesthesia, all of which predispose patients \nto the development of SSIs [ 41 ]. In this study, contaminated wounds \nwere signiﬁcantly associated with SSIs ( P = 0.019). This result sup- \nports other similar studies performed in Dassie [ 45 ], Ethiopian hospi- \ntals [ 50 ], Jimma [ 44 ], Wolaita Sodo [ 30 ], Western Ethiopia [ 42 ], and \nHarari [ 39 ]. This indicates that contaminated wounds have a higher risk \nof infection than clean wounds. In this study, open surgical sites were \n2.64 times more likely to develop SSIs compared to closed surgical sites \n( P = 0.046). This agrees with similar studies conducted in India [ 56 ]. It \nmight be due to the fact that open sites have more exposure to external \nenvironmental contaminants, and hospital environments are known to \nharbour various nosocomial pathogens. According to the present study, \n"
