Out of these the\npredominant bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus 44 (35.77%), Klebsiella species 29 (22.76%) and Coagulase\nnegative Staphylococci (CoNS) 18 (14.63%). No bacterial isolates was found to be sensitive to all antibiotics tested.\nIsolated bacteria showed 102/123 (82.92%) multi drug resistance to the commonly used antibiotics in the hospital.\nHowever, 54/ 65 (83.1%) of Gram negative and 58/58 (100%) of Gram positive isolates were sensitive to Gentamicin\nand Vancomycin, respectively.\nConclusion: Prevalence of was Post-operative wound infections rate in this current study was 75% and multi drug\nresistance was seen in 102/123(82.92%) of the isolates leaving clinicians with few choices of drugs for the treatment\nof post surgical wound infected patients. This underscores for periodic surveillance of etiologic agent and antibiotic\nsusceptibility to prevent further emergence and spread of resistant bacteria pathogens.\n"

    "text": "Background\nPost-operative wound infections are major global problem\nin the field of surgery leading to many complications, in-\ncreased morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Most post-surgical\nwound infections are hospital acquired and vary from one\nhospital to the other [3]. Lack of standardized criteria for\ndiagnosis presents a challenge to monitor the global epi-\ndemiology of surgical site infection. In addition to this,\nemerging of high anti-microbial resistance among bacter-\nial pathogens has made the management and treatment of\npost-operative wound infections difficult [4]. The situation\nis serious in developing countries due to irrational pre-\nscriptions of antimicrobial agents [5]. The inoculum size,\nvirulence and invasive capability of the organisms have\nbeen reported to influence the risk of infection. Moreover,\nthe physiological state of the tissue in the wound and im-\nmunological integrity of the host also has equal import-\nance in determining occurrence of infection [6,7].\nIn Ethiopia, different studies reported that the prevalence\nof post surgical wound infection ranges from 14.8% -60%\n[8-12]. S. aureus, Kelbsiella species, E. coli, Proteus species,\nStreptococcus species, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas\nspecies and Coagulase negative Staphylococci were reported\nas the most common pathogens [10,11].\nP.aeruginosa is an epitome of opportunistic nosoco-\nmial pathogen, which causes a wide spectrum of infec-\ntions and leads to substantial morbidity in immuno\ncompromised patients. Due to its high drug resistance to\nmany antibiotics, the mortality rate is substantial [12,13].\nIt is known that specific therapeutic options to patients\nwith post surgical wound infections are mainly depend\non data from antimicrobial susceptibility tests generated\nby clinical laboratories or sound epidemiological data\nfrom ongoing nosocomial infection surveillance [11].\nHowever, data on the spectrum of bacteria isolated from\nhospitalized patients and their antimicrobial susceptibility\npatterns to guide post operative wound infection in the re-\ngion is scarce. Furthermore, the magnitude and impact of\nmultidrug resistance bacteria from post wound infections\nare unknown in Ayder referral and teaching hospital.\nThus, this study aimed at determining the prevalence and\ndrug susceptibility pattern of aerobic bacterial pathogens\nin post surgical wound infection in Ayder referral and\nteaching hospital.\n"

This difference in prevalence\nof post-operative infection may be due to variation in com-\nmon nosocomial pathogens inhabitant, difference in policy\nof infection control and prevention between countries and\nhospitals, and study design used in the researches.\nMultiple infections among post surgical wound in-\nfected patients was seen in 23(23.95%) of patients where\nS. aureus and Proteus species was the most common as-\nsociation where are the rest 77(87.5%) have shown single\nbacterial infection. S.aureus followed by Klebsiella spp\nwas the predominant isolate which is in agreement to\nfindings from Kenya [17] and Ethiopia [19]. S. aureus\nwas the most prevalent isolates.

It\ncould also be due to anaerobic bacteria or fungi infection\nwhich we could miss due to the use of culture media that\nonly support the aerobic bacteria [22,23].\nPatients who were given pre-operative antibiotic prophy-\nlaxis (Cloxacilline, Ceftriazone or both) developed more\nsurgical site infections and drug resistance for these drugs.\nThis was similar with the study done in Ethiopia by Taye\n(8) where patients who received preoperative antibiotics\nhave a statistically significant higher wound infection rate\n(p < 0.001).\nThe present in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity test showed\nthat isolated bacteria react differently to various antibiotics.\nThirty six (90%) of the isolated S.aureus in our study were\nsensitive to Gentamicin similar to the report from Ethiopia\n[19,24], Nepal [2] and Uganda [1]. However, 80% resistance\nof S.aureus to Gentamicin was reported elsewhere [25].\nThe difference could be due to the difference in pre-\nscribing this antibiotic for the treatment of the bacteria\nfrom hospital to hospital. All the isolated S.aureus 40\n(100%) were susceptible to Vancomycin in our finding\nexactly the same with that of report from Nepal 100%\n[2] and from West Ethiopia 100% [24].

High resist-\nance rate (98.6-100%) was seen by Klebsiella spp. to Cef-\ntriazone, Ampicillin and Amoxicillin similar to the\nreport by from Ethiopia [24].
