    "text": "Occurrence of Post-Surgical Wound Infections, \nBacterial Isolates, and their Susceptibility to \nCommonly Used Antibiotics at Kenyatta National \nHospital, Kenya \n \nMagdaline Burugu1, Andrew Nyerere2, Susan Odera3, Lameck Ontweka4 \nEmail: magdalene.burugu[at]uonbi.ac.ke \n \n \nAbstract: Surgical site infections are now the most common and costly of all hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), accounting for 20% \nof all HAIs. This was a cross-sectional study to determine the occurrence of SSI, the common causative microbes and their antibacterial \nsusceptibility pattern. Sixty-two specimens from various types of surgical wounds were processed by standard methods and \nantimicrobial susceptibility testing done by disc diffusion method. Recovered bacteria were Staphylococcusaureus (29.6%), \nEscherichiacoli (22.2%), Pseudomonasaeruginosa (12.9%), Enterococcusfaecalis and Enterobacterspp (7.4%), Klebsiellaspp (5.6%), \nStreptococcuspyogenes (3.7%) and Acinetobacterspp (1.9%).62.5% of the S. aureus were Methicillin-resistant MRSA, while 75% of E. \nfaecalis were resistant to Vancomycin. Gram-negative rods were highly resistant to Ceftriaxone. Control and prevention measures \nshould be put into place as strategy to minimize the incidence of SSIs and the spread of resistance isolates.  \n \nKeywords: Surgical site infection, antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics, Kenya \n \n1. \nBackground \n \nSurgical site infection (SSI) rates in low-and middle-income \ncountries (LMICs) range from 8 to 30% of procedures, \nmaking them the most frequent healthcare-acquired infection \n(HAI) with substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic \nimpacts  (Mehtar et al., 2020) . SSIs impact many aspects of \nthe patient journey including, increased pain and reduction \nin mobility, delayed wound healing, increased use of \nantibiotics, a common need for additional surgery, increased \nlength of hospital stay, and increased mortality  (Harrop et \nal., 2012) . Most wound infections are caused by \ncontamination during surgery with the patient’s own \nmicro‐organisms  (Townsend et al., 2016) . They may be \nsuperficial and self‐limiting, involving the skin only, or they \nmay be deeper and life‐threatening. SSIs are classified by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as \nsuperficial incisional, deep incisional and organ/space \ninfections  (Heal et al., 2016)  \n \nTo treat SSI, antibiotics are commonly used, however, the \nrise in antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an impediment to \nwound healing  (Harrop et al., 2012) . Overuse and misuse \nof antibiotics in LMICs is a probable contributing factor to \nABR development  (Manenzhe et al., 2015) . The small \namount of data available from LMICs raises a real concern \nabout the dynamic spread of multi-drug-and extensively-\ndrug resistant bacteria, especially Gram-negatives, in \nsettings where the availability of appropriate treatments is \nabsent.  \n \n2. \nLiterature Review \n \nArya et al. (2005)  in a prospective survey of SSI conducted \nin India (Arya etal., 2000) that evaluated 516 bacteria \nisolates from pus samples collected from post operative \nwounds found Staphylococcusaureus to be the most frequent \nisolate \nbacteria \nfollowed \nby \nEscherichiacoli, \n"

(2003)  to evaluate \nantimicrobial susceptibility pattern among the most common \nbacteria associated with post operative wound infection, also \nreported S. aureus as the most common isolates. In addition, \nthey reported most of the isolates as being resistant to \nampicilin and amoxicillin.

Antimicrobial \nresistance has become a serious worldwide public health \nproblem and global strategies of interventions to slow the \nemergence and reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistant \nmicroorganisms have been and continue to be formulated  \n(Bratzler & Houck, 2004) .  \n \nProblem definition \nSSIs are the 2nd leading nosocomial infectious with a \nprevalence of 2.6% globally. SSI prevalence ranges between \n4.3% to 21% in Nigeria and 8% to 11% in Kenya. There are \nlimited published data on the prevalence of bacteria isolates \ncausing Surgical Site Infections and their antibiotic \nsusceptibility patterns at the surgical wards of Kenyatta \nNational Hospital to help guide antimicrobial prophylaxis \nand patient care. The study of surgical site infections is \nimportant to give the trend of bacteria causing SSI in KNH. \nWith increasing emergence of drug resistances in some \npathogenic bacteria there is needed to determine the bacteria \ncausing SSIs and evaluate their antibiotic patterns. The \nresults of this study could help formulate an policy on SSIs \ncontrol. As such, this study aimed at determining the \noccurrence of post-surgical infections in KNH, their bacteria \n"

The participants were purposively \nrecruited into the study. KNH is the largest referral and \nteaching hospital in Kenya and has a wide catchment.  \nTo be included in this study one had to be an adult (>18 \nyears), had undergone surgery at KNH, had an identifiable \nsuperficial SSI with the following signs: a purulent exudate \ndraining from surgical site, swelling erythema, pain, local \ntemperature and peri wound cellulitis or the surgeon’s \ndiagnosis of infection after the surgical period and consented \nto participate in the study. Immunocompromised patients \nand those on long term treatment with corticosteroids were \nexcluded.  \n \nSpecimen Collection \nParticipant clinical data and other demographic data were \ncollected. Pus from the surgical wounds were collected \nusing sterile cotton swabs and immediately transported to \nthe laboratory at the Department of Medical microbiology of \nthe University of Nairobi (UoN) for bacteriological studies.  \n \nOnce in the laboratory, each participant sample was \ninoculated onto two blood agar (BA) and one MacConkey \n(MAC) plate. One BA plate was incubated under 5%-10% \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) in a candle jar, the second BA plate \nand MAC plate were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 \nhours. After 24 hours, the plates were examined for growth, \nthose with no growth were re-incubated for extra 24 hours to \nenable the growth of slow growing bacteria. Plates that had \npresence of growth were classified on whether they had a \nmixed or pure growth. Isolates were identified by their \ncolonial morphological characteristics and the effect they \nhad on the media. A colony was picked and a slide smear \nmade \nfollowed \nby \ngram \nstaining \nfor \nmicroscopic \nexamination. Convectional biochemical tests: e. g., catalase, \ncoagulase, indole, urease, and oxidase, Methyl red, vogues \nproskauer, citrate utilization test, motility test, carbohydrate \nfermentation tests were done for identification and were \nidentified according to Bargey’s manual and manual of \nclinical microbiology (Holt 2003). For gram-negative rods, \nthey were inoculated in Triple Sugar Iron agar and in \nanalytical profile index (API 20E) for identification.  \n \nAntibiotic susceptibility testing  \nIdentified bacteria were cultured on Mueller Hinton agar \nwhile Streptococcuspyogenes isolates were cultured on BA \nfor antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Kirby Bauer disk \ndiffusion method was used for the susceptibility testing. \nQuality control was assured by adding Staphylococciaureus \nATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 as control.  \n \nStaphylococcusaureus isolates were also subjected to \nmethicillin susceptibility testing using Oxacillin discs.  \n \n \n"

    "text": "Methicillin resistance Staphylococcusaureus were at 56.3% \nof isolates. E. faecalis isolates showed high resistance to \nVancomycin (75%). This resistance pattern for both S. \naureus and E. faecalis confirmed that MRSA and VRE \nclinical isolates are important causes of hospital acquired \nsurgical site infections. Our results on MSRA resistance is \nsimilar to the study done in Mulago hospital by Kironde et \nal. \n(2001) \n. \nThe \nresistance \nobserved \nin \nStaphylococcusaureus could also be attributed to irrational \nuse of antibiotics for conditions that may not clinically \nindicate their use, over the counter sell of antibiotics in \npharmacies without prescription by authorised practitioners, \nsome new drug and formulations which may be of poor \nquality and dumping of banned products into the market \nwhere the public may get access to them  (Kironde et al., \n2001). Staphylococcusaureus was isolated across the various \nanatomical sites e. g. thigh (18.8%), knee (25%), cheek and \nchest (6.3%). Thismay be due to surface contamination by \norganisms on the skin and environment causing nosocomial \ninfections  (Kironde et al., 2001) .  \n \n6. \nConclusions \n \nWe should clearly understand and identify SSIs as a problem \nand devise a system to track, analyse and monitor these in \nour hospitals. In view of such highly resistance isolates \ncausing SSIs in our hospital it will be very difficult to treat \nthese cases, so the only hope lies within prevention of such \ninfections. There is also need to be careful in selection of \nantibiotic regime in SSIs cases to minimize incoming \nmagnitude of drug resistance among bacteria.  \n \n7. \nFuture Scope \n \nThere is need for continuous surveillance genotypic \ncharacterization of clinical isolates and their antimicrobial \nsusceptibility patterns. Surgical site Infections need to be \nprevented \nby \nthe \nsurgeons’ \npersonnel, \noperation \nenvironment should be clean and aseptic and modern \noperating techniques should be employed. Patients should be \neducated on importance of hygiene after undergoing surgery \nto minimize contamination of the surgical sites. Since a high \nproportion of samples had positive cultures, infections \ncontrol is recommended as a strategy to minimize speedy \nresistance organisms’ future studies should be extended to \ninclude cultures under anaerobic conditions to establish \npresence of other bacteria that require such environment for \ngrowth. There is need to develop National surveillance of \nantibiotic resistant organisms.  \n \nReferences \n \n[1] \nAnguzu, J., & Olila, D. (2007).
