    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Surgical site infection is the most common postoperative complication worldwide, representing a major burden \nfor patients and health systems. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence and bacterial profile that cause surgical \nsite infection among patients who underwent surgery in parts of Northeast Ethiopia.\nMethods: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from \nJuly 22 to October 25, 2016. A total of 338 patients from the obstetrics and gynecology and general surgical wards were \nincluded, through consecutive sampling technique. The specimens were collected aseptically on the first day when the \npatients had presented with clinical evidence of infection and then sent to the microbiology laboratory. The data were \nentered and analyzed by SPSS version 20, and the results were explained by frequency distribution in tables and figures.\nResults: The majority of participants were female (74.3%) and more than half (61.2%) of the surgeries were performed in \nthe gynecology and obstetrics ward. Clinically, 49 patients (14.5%) were diagnosed as developing surgical site infection, and \nwound swabs were taken for bacteriological study. About 41 (83.7%) swabs showed bacterial growth, indicating 12.13% \noverall prevalence of bacterial surgical site infection. Out of 48 bacterial isolates, more than half (56.25%) of them were \nGram negative. The most frequent isolate was Staphylococcus aureus, 14 (66.67%), followed by Escherichia coli, 9 (33.33%). \nOut of the total bacterial isolates, 38 (79.2%) isolates were found to be multidrug resistant, and the rate of multidrug \nresistant was higher among Gram-negative isolates.\nConclusion: An average rate of surgical site infection was found to be reported and significant numbers of bacterial isolates \nwere also detected. The highest rate of surgical site infection was reported in prostate surgery, followed by small bowel, \nvaginal hysterectomy, and exploratory laparotomy surgical procedures. Periodic surveillance on the incidence rate and \nbacterial profile along with the determination of their antibiotic susceptibility should be performed.\n"

A global, multicenter study across \n66 countries including low-income, middle-income, and \nhigh-income countries indicated that the overall incidence of \nSSI was 12.3%.7 Among study participants in Sierra Leone, \nthe incidence of SSI reported was 11.5%.8 A systematic \nreview and meta-analysis in sub-Saharan Africa indicated \nthat the pooled incidence of SSI was 14.8%.9 A relatively \nlow incidence rate of SSI was revealed in a study conducted \nin China.10 In Ethiopia, a similar study revealed the overall \nincidence of SSI to be 21.1%.11 The incidence of SSI in these \nstudies showed that the problem is still worsening in devel-\noping countries compared to developed countries. A study \nconducted in low- and middle-income countries showed \nanother rationale for the increasing burden of SSI in wide \nareas of those regions as well as globally.12 In different parts \nof the world, either elective or emergent types of surgery \nhave been performed at various points in time. In each of \nthese surgery types, various surgical procedures have been \naccomplished successfully. But the bad scenario is that \npatients who undergo these surgical procedures are highly \nvulnerable to SSI.13–15 These SSIs can be reduced while we \ncomply with infection prevention practices; this was demon-\nstrated by the reduction of SSIs during COVID-19, which \nincluded compliance with hand hygiene, universal mask \nusage, and social distancing practices.16,17\n"

The test for antibiotic susceptibility \nwas performed by using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion \nmethod on Mueller–Hinton agar using antibiotics according \nto the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) \nguideline.29 The Mueller–Hinton agar was enriched with 5% \nsheep blood in the case of fastidious bacteria like \nStreptococcus species. Several isolated colonies of similar \nmorphology were taken carefully and suspended in sterile \nnutrient broth and/or sterile normal saline. The suspension \nwas then gently agitated to get a uniform suspension and the \nturbidity of the suspension was matched with the McFarland \n0.5% barium sulfate opacity standard. A sterile swab was \ndipped into the suspension of the isolate, squeezed against \nthe side of the tube to remove excess fluid and spread over \nthe Mueller–Hinton agar plate following the SOP. Sensitivity \ndiscs for appropriate drugs were placed on the media and \nincubated at 37°C for 24 h.9 The final identification of the \nbacteria was made by taking into account the results of the \nvarious biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns \nwere reported by measuring the zone of inhibition on a mil-\nlimeter scale. The antibiotic discs were reported as suscepti-\nble, intermediate, susceptible-dose dependent, and resistant, \nbased on the criteria provided by CLSI document M100-S24. \nWe have used two 150 mm antimicrobial susceptibility testing \n(AST) plates for each of the Gram-positive bacterial isolate.\nMethicillin resistance for S. aureus and CoNS was deter-\nmined by a disc diffusion test using a cefoxitin (30 μg) disc \non Mueller–Hinton agar. Plates were incubated and main-\ntained at 33–35°C for 24 h. Results were interpreted accord-\ning to CLSI guidelines, that is, for S. aureus and CoNS, zone \ndiameters ⩽21 and ⩽24 mm, respectively, were considered \nresistant to methicillin. Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases \n(ESBL) production was screened on Mueller–Hinton agar \nwith a 30 μg ceftriaxone disc, and isolates with zone diame-\nters of ⩽25 mm were considered positive for ESBL screen-\ning according to CLSI guidelines and confirmed using the \ndouble disc approximation method. Discs containing ceftazi-\ndime (30 μg) and cefotaxime (30 μg) were placed 20 mm \ncenter-to-center with the amoxicillin/clavulanate (20/10 μg) \ndisc. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 18–20 h. An \nenhanced zone of inhibition toward the amoxicillin/clavula-\nnate (20/10 μg) disc was considered positive for ESBL pro-\nduction.30 \nMultidrug-resistant \n(MDR) \nbacteria \nwere \nidentified based on the ECDC definition, in which a bacte-\nrium is classified as MDR when the isolate is non-suscepti-\nble to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial \ncategories.31 For Gram-positive organisms, susceptibility \nwas tested against penicillin (10 units), ampicillin (10 μg), \nceftriaxone (30 μg), vancomycin (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), \nerythromycin (15 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), ciprofloxacin \n(5 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \n(1.25/23.75 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), \ncefepime (30 μg), and chloramphenicol (30 μg).
