A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from October 1st \n2022 to January 31st, 2023. Data collected from patient medical record cards and patient interviews \nwere entered and analyzed using SPSS V26.0. The determinants of surgical site infection were \ndetermined from the multivariable logistic regression. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically \nsignificant. Ceftriaxone (70.5%) followed by a combination of ceftriaxone with metronidazole \n(21.90%) was the most frequently used prophylactic antibiotic. One hundred fifty-nine (78%) of \npatients were exposed to inappropriately used prophylactic antimicrobials and 62.2% of these \nwere exposed to inappropriately selected antibiotics. One hundred twenty-six (61.9%) patients \ndeveloped Surgical Site Infection (SSI). Duration of procedure longer than an hour and inappropriate \nuse of antimicrobial prophylaxiswere the independent predictors for the occurrence of surgical site \ninfections. Patients whose operation was lasted in longer than an hour were 3.39 times more likely to \ndevelop SSI compared to those whose operation was completed in less than an hour, AOR = 3.39 (95% \nCI: 1.24–9.30). Similarly, controlling the effect of other covariate variables, individuals who were given \ninappropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis were 6.67 times more likely to develop SSI compared to those \ngiven appropriate prophylaxis, AOR = 6.67 (95% CI: 1.05–42.49). The high rate of SSI requires due \nattention from clinicians as well as health policymakers.

    "text": "especially if patient-related risk factors for SSIs are ­present3,5. When appropriately used, surgical antimicrobial \nprophylaxis is an effective method for preventing the occurrence of ­SSI6,7. For optimal benefit, determining the \nappropriate indication based on definitive microbiological tests, and timing, selecting an agent that covers the \nlikely pathogen on wound contamination, and administering sufficient bactericidal concentrations during the \nwhole period that the incision is open for risk of bacterial contamination is ­required6–8.\nSurgical site infection is one of the most common nosocomial infections causing complications of operative \nprocedures which have a significant burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. SSI is the \nthird among all reported cases of inpatient nosocomial infections. Accounted for up to 16% of nosocomial infec-\ntions in all hospitalized patients and 38% of all surgical ­patients2,9. Based on the wound’s level of contamination, \nthere are four classes of surgical wounds: clean (wound with no inflammation), clean-contaminated (wound in \nwhich the respiratory, alimentary or genitourinary tracts are entered but without contamination), contaminated \n(wound where acute inflammation (without pus) is encountered, or where there is visible contamination of the \nwound.), and dirty-infected (wound in the presence of pus, where there is a previously perforated hollow viscous \nor compound/open injury more than four hours old)9,10.\nDevelopment of SSIs results in up to 60% increased risk of spending time in an intensive care unit, being \nreadmitted to a hospital, and nearly doubled mortality rates compared to patients without ­SSIs1. World Health \nOrganization (WHO) estimated that the burden of nosocomial infection from SSI in low- and middle-income \ncountries ranges from 1.2–23.6% and this incident is three to five times higher than in high-income countries \ndue to the poor infection prevention programs, crowding hospital environment and irrational prescription of \nantimicrobial ­agents2,8,11,12. Irrational use of prophylactic antibiotics is associated with increased medical care \ncosts, prolonged hospitalization, superinfection, the emergence of poly antimicrobial-resistant strains of hospital \npathogens that challenge the patient care process, and adverse drug reactions, and this phenomenon is being \naggravated by the absence of culture and sensitivity tests in treating ­infections2. Although the data is limited, in \nEthiopia, 9.4–75% of patients who underwent surgical procedures developed SSI at different ­hospitals13–16. Fur-\nthermore, a report from a meta-analysis study indicated that the estimated pooled occurrence of SSI in Ethiopia \nwas 12.3%11. From an estimated 30–50% of the antimicrobials used for surgical prophylaxis in hospitals, 30–90% \nwere ­inappropriate17. The use of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis before any surgery in an appropriate way \nis an important measure to prevent SSI. However inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents like inappropriate \nselection, timing, and duration are associated with an increase in the worldwide emergence of antimicrobial \nresistance, a major public health problem, and has a significant impact on treatment and outcomes. Moreover, \nthere will be also increased risks of occurrence of surgical site infections, and adverse drug reactions thus strongly \ncalling for the evaluation of ­SAP15,17.\nThere are no studies conducted on surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis and surgical site infections at Debre \nBerhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (DBCSH). Therefore, this study aimed to assess SSI and surgical \nantimicrobial prophylaxis utilization patterns, appropriateness, and associated factors among patients admitted \nto the surgical ward of DBCSH. Investigating the appropriateness of surgical prophylactic antibiotics use and \nsubsequent occurrence of SSI at the ward level can generate detailed information about the magnitude and com-\nposition of antibiotic consumption and give insight into the rationality of prescribing in the process of patient \ncare. This will help policymakers to make recommendations, monitor, evaluate, and suggest modifications in \nthe level of practice and diagnostic techniques, and practitioner’s prescription habits, so as to make patient care \nreasonable and effective. The generated data and recommendations will be utilized also in the future for the \npromotion of rational antibiotic use in DBCSH.\nThis study will also be used as a pilot study for national surveillance studies regarding antibiotic utilization and \nresistance which will change the unregulated use of antibiotics for common diseases. Furthermore, the findings \nof this study can be used as a baseline for further studies conducted in this area.\n"

This is only confirmed by clinical signs and symptoms of surgical site infections.\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis outcome: is a term used to indicate the presence or absence of surgical site \ninfections.\nAppropriate Surgical Antibiotics Prophylaxis: using the right antimicrobial when only indicated at the right \ntime and for the right duration during the surgical procedures.\nRight antimicrobial: Antimicrobials that are prescribed inexpensive, non-toxic, and limited-spectrum and \nare in accordance with local and national policies and ­guidelines6,7.\nRight duration: Prescribing the shortest antibiotic course (not more than 24 h) that is likely to be effective for \nthe presenting patient’s condition. Be discontinued within 24 h after the end of surgery, to prevent the emergence \nof resistance.\nAppropriate timing of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis: defined as the administration of antimicrobials in \na range of 30 to 60 min prior to the incision to achieve prophylactic level during surgery and optimize efficacy \nas per the predetermined ability of antimicrobials to be administered to reach peak levels in tissue.\n"

As depicted in Table 1, nearly three-fourths (73.5%) of \npatients were males. The minimum age of the study participants was 18 years while the maxim was 77 years old \nand their mean age was 34.13 ± 12.8. About 54.3% of the study participants were residents of rural areas.\nRegarding the clinical characteristics of patients, only 45 (22.1%) of patients have comorbid conditions, and \nthe most common comorbid condition identified was hypertension 18 (40%) followed by peptic ulcer disease 10 \n(22.2%). The majority (79.9%) of patients included in the study don’t have a history of regular use of social drugs \nlike alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, and khat. The clean contaminated wound was the most commonly encountered \nwound class which accounted for 130 (63.7%) of all cases. More than two-thirds, 157 (77.1%) of the patients \nunderwent emergency surgery while the rest were elective surgery. The most common type of surgery encoun-\ntered in this study was gastrointestinal surgery (146, 71.6%) while the least type was head and neck surgery (2, \n1%). Only 25 (12.5%) of patients need a blood transfusion to undergo the surgical procedure (Table 1).\n"

    "text": "Discussion\nDetermination of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis outcome is essential for the reduction of morbidity; unnecessary \nhospital stays and related costs by revealing the level of evidence required to avoid inappropriate use of drugs \nduring the management of a patient undergoing surgery with ­prophylaxis18. Hence, this study was carried out \nto assess surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis outcomes and associated factors among patients admitted to the \nsurgical ward of DBCSH, which was a hospital located in the northeast of Ethiopia.\nThe current study showed that 61.8% of patients developed SSI. This finding was higher than the finding of \nprevious studies conducted in different Hospitals in Ethiopia that reported 10.2–23.4% of patients developed \n­SSI1,9,10,13,15,16,18,19. The higher occurrence of SSI in our study might be due to the lack of adequate infection con-\ntrol systems, and inappropriate use of antibiotics like ceftriaxone in surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis which \nis not indicated due to its lower activity against bacteria commonly encountered in elective surgery including \ngram-positive cocci which are the common organisms causing SSIs or it may be due to differences in the type of \nsurgical procedures, professional differences, and operation environmental and patient-related factors including \nthe presence of immune compromising comorbidities like HIV and diabetes. Moreover, it might be also due \nto the absence of recommended prophylactic antibiotics use due to the lack of a culture and sensitivity study. \nThis means the pathogens responsible for surgical site infections may not have been covered by the prophylactic \nantibiotics or they may have developed resistance to these agents.\nNonetheless, the prevalence was lower than in a study conducted at Ayder Teaching and Referral ­Hospital14, \nwhere a 75% prevalence of SSI is reported. This could be because the previous study has been done on patients \nwho are clinically suspected to be having SSI.\nIn this study, almost all of the SSIs identified (93.6%) have occurred before discharge from the hospital. This \nfinding is in line with a prospective study conducted at Wachemo University Nigist Eleni Mohammed Memorial \nHospital which reported that 90.47% of patients developed SSIs in the ­hospital20. This similarity in the timing \nof occurrence of SSI could be due to the similarity in the level of care provided to patients during their hospital \nstay. It might be also due to the high prevalence of undetected pathogens causing an infection in both settings \nand the absence of an antimicrobial stewardship program that enables the prudent use of antimicrobials.\nIn this study, the majority of surgical procedures underwent were clean-contaminated surgeries (63.7%) \nwhich is in line with a study conducted at Borumeda Hospital where a higher number of patients (48%) have a \nclean-contaminated wound. However, it opposed the finding of other ­studies2,8,11,20 conducted at different times \nin different areas where the majority of procedures (38.1%, 40.5%, 54%, and 56.5%) respectively were clean.\nRegarding the type of SSI identified in this study, the majority (58%) of them were superficial incisional while \nthe rest 42% were deep incisional infections, which is similar to the finding of other ­studies2,15,19. The highest \nprevalence of superficial incisional infections might be due to the higher prevalence of pathogens responsible \n"

However, the finding was not in line with a retrospective review which \nreported about 54.6% superficial or deep incisional SSI, and 45.4% organ/space ­SSI21. In our study, no organ/\nspace SSI was identified. This variation in the type of SSI might be due to the difference in the type of procedure, \nquality of care, or variation in the patient-related risk factor.\nSelection of antimicrobials for surgical site infections should be based on the antimicrobial coverage against \nsuspected pathogen types causing SSI which may vary depending on anatomical location, operation type, and \npatterns of local antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, the cost of antimicrobials, pharmacokinetics, and narrowness \nin the spectrum of activity should be taken into account in their ­selection11. Though different guidelines claimed \ncefazolin as the first choice of surgical prophylaxis antimicrobial ­agent6,7,17, ceftriaxone was the most commonly \nused (70.5%) antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis in this study. The use of third-generation cephalosporins like \nceftriaxone in surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated due to their lower activity against bacteria \ncommonly encountered in elective surgery including gram-positive cocci which are the common organisms \ncausing SSIs, and their higher ­cost17. This finding was in line with a similar study conducted in different parts of \n­Ethiopia2,8,11,15,17,18,21,23. The high utilization rate of ceftriaxone in the present study might be due to the unavail-\nability of first and second-generation cephalosporins, the availability of ceftriaxone, belief of broad-spectrum \nantibiotics are more effective in preventing SSIs, low adherence to healthcare professionals to hospital protocols. \nIt might be also due to the unavailability of culture and sensitivity test which obliges health practitioners to use \na broad spectrum of antimicrobials to cover the most likely pathogen.\nHowever, the finding of our study is not in line with the study conducted in South Africa, and Botswana \nwhere cefazolin and cefotaxime were the most frequently utilized ­antibiotics24,25. This difference might be due \nto variations in drug availability, or the types of procedures performed for the patients.\nAppropriate use of SAP decreases the occurrence of SSI while inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents \nsuch as inappropriate selection, timing, and duration are associated with an increase in the prevalence of anti-\nbiotic resistance, cause adverse drug reactions, and increased risk of surgical site ­infections15,21. The present \nstudy revealed that only about 22.1% of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis used was appropriate as per available \n­guidelines6,7. This was in line with a study conducted at Ayder Hospital which reported 21.9% ­compliance23. The \nfinding was lower than a study conducted in France where 51% of patients received SAP according to ­guidelines26 \nbut higher than the study conducted at Borumeda ­Hospital17. This variation might be due to variations in the \nexperience of professionals or variations in drugs available at a particular hospital.\nIn our study, inappropriate antibiotic selection was the dominant (62.2%) reason for inappropriate antibiotic \nuse for surgical prophylaxis. This supports the finding of similar studies conducted at Nekemte Referral Hos-\npital.5%)8, Ayder (north Ethiopia) (89.5%)23, and Palestine (81.5%)27. The finding was not concordant with the \nfinding of a study conducted in ­Australia5 where the most common reason for inappropriate procedural SAP was \nincorrect timing (44.9%), and it was lower than the finding of a study at the Gaffrée e Guinle University Hospital \nwhere the choice of the administered antibiotic was considered correct in 97.9% of ­patients28. The difference \nmight be due to in availability of first-line medication and poor implementation of guidelines.\nMany guidelines recommend single-dose surgical prophylaxis and the duration should not be more than \n24 ­h6–8. In our study, the duration of SAP administration was not concordant in 28 (26.8%) of patients. This was \nconsistence with a study conducted at Hawassa University Referral Hospital where the duration of SAP admin-\nistration is concordant in 18.4% of patients taking ­antibiotics22. However, it was lower than the finding of a study \nconducted in Palestine where only 31.8% of patients received an antibiotic for an appropriate ­duration27. This \ndifference could be due to differences in the knowledge of health professionals across different healthcare settings.\nAnother common failure of guidelines compliance investigated in this study was the wrong timing of antibiot-\nics. In the present study, 24.2% of patients were exposed to the wrong timing of antibiotics administration. This \nsupports the finding of the study conducted in Dessie, Palestine, and Jimma where (59.8%, 48.6%, and 56%) of \npatients received their first dose at the appropriate time ­respectively15,27,29.\nIn our study, the duration of surgery longer than an hour and inappropriate use of SAP was identified as inde-\npendent predictors of surgical site infection occurrence. Similar to our study, studies conducted in different parts \nof Ethiopia reported that a prolonged duration of surgery (more than an hour) was associated with increased \nrisks of ­SSI1,15,20,30. Another study conducted in Hawassa also revealed that the inappropriate use of poor surgical \nantimicrobial prophylaxis increases the development of antimicrobial resistance, and ­SSI22.\nMany other studies reported the association of SSI with, comorbidity, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, older \nage, contaminated and dirty wound class, failure to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or delayed initiation of anti-\nbiotic prophylaxis, prolonged preoperative hospital stay, previous hospitalization or surgery, and emergency \nsurgical ­cases13–17.\n"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe higher rate of SSI in the study area despite the institution of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis calls for the con-\nsideration of definitive laboratory diagnosis with culture and sensitivity study to come up with recommended \nantibiotics usage. Bacterial culture confirmation should be done for all patients who developed clinical signs and \nsymptoms of surgical site infections. Policymakers should pinpoint the establishment and implementation of \nan antimicrobial and diagnostic stewardship approach that will produce better patient outcomes in the future. \nHealth providers who are engaged in surgical ward service should follow the recommendation of guidelines, to \ncome up with the appropriate use of prophylaxis antibiotics in terms of selection, time of administration, and \nduration of prophylaxis. Including clinical pharmacists in the surgical ward service team should be also consid-\nered to ensure proper surgical antibiotic prophylaxis utilization. Moreover, appropriate prophylactic drugs like \ncefazolin should be procured and availed to prescribers.\n"
